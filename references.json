		"abstract": "Assuming that the intellectual level of the classroom affects the quality of learning environments, it is argued that separating students into homogeneous educational frameworks enriches the environment for high-resource students and impoverishes it for low-resource students, whereas the converse occurs under heterogeneous mixing. Academic achievement consequently will be affected. This argument was subjected to an empirical analysis in two Israeli samples, one ethnically and socioeconomically heterogeneous, the other socially homogeneous. First, presuppositions concerning the impact of three dimensions of student-body composition on academic achievement were probed. It was found that (a) the intellectual component of student-body composition outweighs both ethnic and socioeconomic components; (b) classroom composition is more effective than school composition; and (c) classroom intellectual level is more effective than its variance. Subsequently, two hypotheses were supported: classroom intellectual composition positively affects the student’s academic achievement, and compositional quality and personal ability interact (i.e., low-resource students are more sensitive than high-resource students to compositional quality). An educational implication follows: In separation, the low-resource students’ loss is greater than the high-resource students’ profit, and in mixing, the high-resource students’ loss is smaller than the low-resource students’ gain.",

		"abstract": "Zusammenfassung. Es werden Befunde der Münchner Längsschnittstudie zur Genese individueller Kompetenzen (LOGIK) vorgestellt, die die Rechtschreibentwicklung vom späten Kindesalter bis zum frühen Erwachsenenalter thematisieren. Die bereits für die Grundschulphase der Studie festgestellte hohe Zeitstabilität individueller Unterschiede im Rechtschreiben wird auch für die spätere Phase bestätigt. Frühe Vorteile der weiblichen Teilnehmer und der Probanden mit höherem Bildungsniveau setzten sich ebenfalls fort. Vom Jugendalter bis zum frühen Erwachsenenalter waren keine nennenswerten Leistungszuwächse erkennbar. Insgesamt deuten die Befunde für die Jugend- und Erwachsenenphase darauf hin, dass sich das durchschnittliche Rechtschreibniveau im Verlauf der letzten vier Jahrzehnte erheblich verschlechtert hat.",

Simple correlations between these achievement areas and both VIQ and FSIQ are highly significant, while correlations that involve PIQ are nonsignificant. Multiple regression analysis further revealed that, after VIQ no additional variance in any of the achievement areas was accounted for by PIQ.",

This research established the relationship between SAT and g, as well as the appropriateness of the SAT as a measure of g, and examined the SAT as a premorbid measure of intelligence. In Study 1, we used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Measures of g were extracted from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery and correlated with SAT scores of 917 participants. The resulting correlation was .82 (.86 corrected for nonlinearity). Study 2 investigated the correlation between revised and recentered SAT scores and scores on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices among 104 undergraduates. The resulting correlation was .483 (.72 corrected for restricted range). These studies indicate that the SAT is mainly a test of g. We provide equations for converting SAT scores to estimated IQs; such conversion could be useful for estimating premorbid IQ or conducting individual difference research with college students.",

		"abstract": "International cognitive ability and achievement comparisons stem from different research traditions. But analyses at the interindividual data level show that they share a common positive manifold. Correlations of national ability means are even higher to very high (within student assessment studies, r = .60–.98; between different student assessment studies [PISA‐sum with TIMSS‐sum] r = .82–.83; student assessment sum with intelligence tests, r = .85–.86). Results of factor analyses indicate a strong g‐factor of differences between nations (variance explained by the first unrotated factor: 94–95%). Causes of the high correlations are seen in the similarities of tests within studies, in the similarities of the cognitive demands for tasks from different tests, and in the common developmental factors at the individual and national levels including known environmental and unknown genetic influences.

Approximately 1200 law school stu dents constituted a professional school sample and another 1200 students in mathematics, physics, and chemistry constituted a graduate school sample. Earlier findings were replicated. In addition, it is shown that both graduate and professional school grades form simplex matrices and that early grades are more highly predictable from aptitude tests than later grades. There is evidence for a single simplex matrix extending through the four under graduate and three post-graduate years only in the law school sample. There are two separate simplex matrices for the two levels in the graduate school sample. Correlations between test scores and under graduate grades are biased to very low values in the professional school sample by a compensatory selec tion system, but both aptitude and achievement tests are clearly more highly correlated with fresh- man than with senior grades in the graduate school sample. In this sample, however, the advanced test in the discipline is more highly correlated with first year graduate grades than with senior grades. These data suggest that the first year in a new aca demic learning situation represents a greater intel lectual challenge than subsequent years.",

The sample included 101,157 students, 6,871 schools, and 128 school districts gathered from 74 independent samples. The results showed a medium to strong SES–achievement relation. This relation, however, is moderated by the unit, the source, the range of SES variable, and the type of SES–achievement measure. The relation is also contingent upon school level, minority status, and school location. The author conducted a replica of White’s (1982) meta-analysis to see whether the SES–achievement correlation had changed since White’s initial review was published. The results showed a slight decrease in the average correlation. Practical implications for future research and policy are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Summary\n            Randomized experiments have become important tools in empirical research. In a completely randomized treatment-control experiment, the simple difference in means of the outcome is un- biased for the average treatment effect, and covariate adjustment can further improve the efficiency without assuming a correctly specified outcome model. In modern applications, experimenters often have access to many covariates, motivating the need for a theory of covariate adjustment under the asymptotic regime with a diverging number of covariates. We study the asymptotic properties of covariate adjustment under the potential outcomes model and propose a bias-corrected estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal under weaker conditions. Our theory is based purely on randomization without imposing any parametric outcome model assumptions. To prove the theoretical results, we develop novel vector and matrix concentration inequalities for sampling without replacement.",

These two desiderata had been somewhat confused in the minds of the experimenters, and the present paper was the author's first attempt at setting out the rational principles on which he might proceed.

This paper serves as a quick reference guide for researchers who design and conduct impact studies in education and related fields. Information presented in this paper may also help research users make better informed judgments about the quality of the research and the credibility of the evidence produced from the research.",

		"abstract": "Statistical power analysis provides the conventional approach to assess error rates when designing a research study. However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction ( Type S [ sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated ( Type M [ magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.",

These studies are often designed with the goal of determining whether a program works, or answering the what works question. Recently, the goals of these studies expanded to include for whom and under what conditions an intervention is effective. In this study, we examine the capacity of a set of CRTs to provide rigorous evidence about for whom and under what conditions an intervention is effective. The findings suggest that studies are more likely to be designed with the capacity to detect potentially meaningful individual-level moderator effects, for example, gender, than cluster-level moderator effects, for example, school type.",

		"abstract": "Background We describe different forms of clustering that may occur in individually randomized trials, where the observed outcomes for different individuals cannot be regarded as independent. We propose random effects models to allow for such clustering, across a range of contexts and trial designs, and investigate their effect on estimation and interpretation of the treatment effect.\n            Methods We apply our proposed models to two individually randomized trials with potential for clustering, a trial of teleconsultation in hospital referral (the main outcome being offer of a further hospital appointment) and a trial of exercise therapy delivered by physiotherapists for low back pain (the outcome being a back pain score). Extensions to the methods include the possibility of explaining heterogeneity between clusters using cluster level characteristics and the potential dilution of cluster effects due to noncompliance.\n            Results In the teleconsultation trial, the odds ratio was significant (1.52, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.82) when clustering was ignored, but smaller and nonsignificant (1.36, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.13) when clustering by hospital consultant was taken into account. The 95% range of estimated treatment effects across consultants was from 0.21 to 8.76. This variability was only partially explained by the specialty of the consultant. In the back pain trial, although there was an overall benefit of exercise (change of 20.51 points on the back pain score) and little evidence of clustering, the estimated treatment effects for different physiotherapists ranged from 21.26 to +0.26 points.\n            Conclusions Clustering is an important issue in many individually randomized trials. Ignoring it can lead to underestimates of the uncertainty and too extreme P-values. Even when there is little apparent heterogeneity across clusters, it can still have a large impact on the estimation and interpretation of the treatment effect.",

		"abstract": "How can researchers in K–12 contexts stay true to the principles of rigorous evaluation designs within the constraints of classroom settings and limited funding? This paper explores this question by presenting a small-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to test the efficacy of curricular supplemental materials on epigenetics. The researchers asked whether the curricular materials improved students’ understanding of the content more than an alternative set of activities. The field test was conducted in a diverse public high school setting with 145 students who were randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison condition. Findings indicate that students in the treatment condition scored significantly higher on the posttest than did students in the comparison group (effect size: Cohen's d = 0.40). The paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the RCT, the contextual factors that influenced its enactment, and recommendations for others wishing to conduct small-scale rigorous evaluations in educational settings. Our intention is for this paper to serve as a case study for university science faculty members who wish to employ scientifically rigorous evaluations in K–12 settings while limiting the scope and budget of their work.",

The methods literature for these trials has grown steadily since they were introduced to the biomedical research community in the late 1970s, and we summarize those developments. We review, in addition to the group-randomized trial, methods for two closely related designs, the individually randomized group treatment trial and the stepped-wedge group-randomized trial. After describing the essential ingredients for these designs, we review the most important developments in the evolution of their methods using a new bibliometric tool developed at the National Institutes of Health. We then discuss the questions to be considered when selecting from among these designs or selecting the traditional randomized controlled trial. We close with a review of current methods for the analysis of data from these designs, a case study to illustrate each design, and a brief summary.",

		"abstract": "Field experiments with nested structures assign entire groups such as schools to treatment and control conditions. Key aspects of such cluster randomized experiments include knowledge of the intraclass correlation structure and the sample sizes necessary to achieve adequate power to detect the treatment effect. The units at each level of the hierarchy have a cost associated with them, however, and thus, researchers need to take budget and costs into account when designing their studies. This article uses analysis of covariance and provides methods for computing power within an optimal design framework that incorporates costs of units at different levels and covariate effects for three-level cluster randomized balanced designs. The optimal sample sizes are a function of the variances at each level and the cost of each unit. Overall, the results suggest that when units at higher levels become more expensive, the researcher should sample units at lower levels. The covariates affect the sampling of units and the power estimates. Fewer units need to be sampled at levels where covariates explain considerable proportions of the variance.",

		"abstract": "This article considers optimal sample allocation between the treatment and control condition in multilevel designs when the costs per sampling unit vary due to treatment assignment. Optimal unequal allocation may reduce the cost from that of a balanced design without sacrificing any power. The optimum sample allocation ratio depends only on the cost ratio between the treatment and control regardless of whether the randomization of sampling units occurs at levels 1, 2, or 3. Power functions for the exact tests for the main effect of treatment are derived for prototypical multilevel designs with unequal sample sizes in the treatment and control condition.",

		"abstract": "Research Spotlights (practice and policy-oriented abstract)\n          , \n            More researchers in academia and industry are now conducting randomized experiments, collecting information beyond just the subjects’ treatment assignments and outcomes. Designing and conducting experiments is costly to researchers and subjects; therefore, it is important to derive greater value from such data. Our article describes how researchers can make use of such extra information by using causal diagrams, by applying a few simple rules based on Judea Pearl’s causal diagramming framework. This allows researchers to find more nuanced insights about the underlying theoretical mechanisms and to generalize the inferences. We illustrate this process by creating causal diagrams for a large randomized field experiment on online dating. We describe the insights that this process reveals.\n          , \n            Researchers using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) often subgroup or condition on auxiliary variables that are not the randomized treatment variable. There are many good reasons to condition on auxiliary variables—also referred to as control variables or covariates—in randomized experiments. In particular, designing and conducting RCTs is costly to researchers and subjects, and therefore it is important to derive greater value from RCT data; measuring not just the average treatment effect (ATE), but also finding more nuanced insights about the underlying theoretical mechanisms and generalizing the inferences. Unfortunately, there are many confusing and even contradictory guidelines on the use of subgroups or auxiliary variables in RCTs. We show how researchers can leverage covariates without biasing their causal inferences, by applying a few simple rules based on Judea Pearl’s causal diagramming framework. We demonstrate how to create a causal schema, through careful and deliberate operationalization of auxiliary covariates, in order to analyze the intermediate effects along a causal chain from the treatment to outcome; and we discuss some other ways to leverage covariates for theory development and generalization of findings from RCTs. We present a criterion for distinguishing pretreatment and posttreatment variables that is based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We provide a succinct set of guidelines to help readers begin to employ some essential techniques of DAG-based causal analysis. Finally, we provide a series of short tutorials (with accompanying simulated data and R scripts) to help readers explore the connections between RCT and observational contexts in causal diagramming. This commentary aims to raise awareness of the DAG methodology, explain its usefulness to experimental research, and encourage adoption in the IS community for studies using RCTs as well as observational data.",

		"abstract": "Abstract. Much research has demonstrated that intelligence and conscientiousness have a high impact on individual school achievement. To figure out if other noncognitive traits have incremental validity over intelligence and conscientiousness, we conducted a study on 498 eighth-grade students from general secondary schools in Austria. Hierarchical regressions for three criteria (GPA, science, and languages) were performed, including intelligence, the Big Five, self-discipline, grit, self-efficacy, intrinsic-extrinsic motivation, and test anxiety. Intelligence and conscientiousness alone accounted for approximately 40% in the variance of school achievement. For languages and GPA, no other personality and motivational predictors could explain additional variance; in science subjects, only self-discipline added incremental variance. We conclude that – in addition to intelligence as powerful cognitive predictor – conscientiousness is the crucial noncognitive predictor for school achievement and should be focused on when supporting students in improving their performance.",

The book concludes with a handy list of recommendations for those actively engaged in or currently preparing research projects\"--",

		"abstract": "The gold standard in making causal inference on program effects is a randomized trial. Most\nrandomization designs in education randomize classrooms or schools rather than individual\nstudents. Such “clustered randomization” designs have one principal drawback: They tend to\nhave limited statistical power or precision. This study aims to provide empirical information\nneeded to design adequately powered studies that randomize schools using data from Florida\nand North Carolina. The authors assess how different covariates contribute to improving the\nstatistical power of a randomization design and examine differences between math and reading\ntests; differences between test types (curriculum‐referenced tests versus norm‐referenced\ntests); and differences between elementary school and secondary school, to see if the test\nsubject, test type, or grade level makes a large difference in the crucial design parameters.\nFinally they assess bias in 2‐level models that ignore the clustering of students in classrooms.",

		"abstract": "This paper provides a guide to calculating statistical power for the complex multilevel designs that are used in most field studies in education research. For multilevel evaluation studies in the field of education, it is important to account for the impact of clustering on the standard errors of estimates of treatment effects. Using ideas from survey research, the paper explains how sample design induces random variation in the quantities observed in a randomized experiment, and how this random variation relates to statistical power. The manner in which statistical power depends upon the values of intraclass correlations, sample sizes at the various levels, the standardized average treatment effect (effect size), the multiple correlation between covariates and the outcome at different levels, and the heterogeneity of treatment effects across sampling units is illustrated. Both hierarchical and randomized block designs are considered. The paper demonstrates that statistical power in complex designs involving clustered sampling can be computed simply from standard power tables using the idea of operational effect sizes: effect sizes multiplied by a design effect that depends on features of the complex experimental design. These concepts are applied to provide methods for computing power for each of the research designs most frequently used in education research.",

		"abstract": "This paper provides practical guidance for researchers who are designing studies that randomize groups to measure the impacts of interventions on children. To do so, the paper: (1) provides new empirical information about the values of parameters that influence the precision of impact estimates (intra-class correlations and R-squares); (2) examines the implications of planning group-randomized studies for three-level hierarchical situations, using empirical information obtained by estimating two-level hierarchical models (which under many conditions appears to not be problematic); and (3) assesses the implications of the uncertainty that exists when the design of group-randomized studies is based on estimates of intra-class correlations. Data for the paper come from two studies: the Chicago Literacy Initiative: Making Better Early Readers study (CLIMBERs) and the School Break-fast Pilot Project (SBPP). The analysis sample from CLIMBERs comprised 430 4-year old children from 47 preschool classrooms in 23 Chicago public schools. The analysis sample from the SBPP study comprised 1,151 third-graders from 233 classrooms in 111 schools in six school districts. Four appendixes are included: (1) Description of Outcome Measures; (2) Definition of the Multiplier M; (3) Complete Set of Results for Three-Level vs. Two-Level Model Comparisons: Nonstandardized Unconditional Variance Components; and (4) Proofs of the Relationship between Three-Level Models and Two-Level Models in Terms of Precision.

		"abstract": "Researchers often mention the utility and need for R-squared measures of explained variance for multilevel models (MLMs). Although this topic has been addressed by methodologists, the MLM R-squared literature suffers from several shortcomings: (a) analytic relationships among existing measures have not been established so measures equivalent in the population have been redeveloped 2 or 3 times; (b) a completely full partitioning of variance has not been used to create measures, leading to gaps in the availability of measures to address key substantive questions; (c) a unifying approach to interpreting and choosing among measures has not been provided, leading to researchers’ difficulty with implementation; and (d) software has inconsistently and infrequently incorporated available measures. We address these issues with the following contributions. We develop an integrative framework of R-squared measures for MLMs with random intercepts and/or slopes based on a completely full decomposition of variance. We analytically relate 10 existing measures from different disciplines as special cases of 5 measures from our framework. We show how our framework fills gaps by supplying additional total and level-specific measures that answer new substantive research questions. To facilitate interpretation, we provide a novel and integrative graphical representation of all the measures in the framework; we use it to demonstrate limitations of current reporting practices for MLM R-squareds, as well as benefits of considering multiple measures from the framework in juxtaposition. We supply and empirically illustrate an R function, r2MLM, that computes all measures in our framework to help researchers in considering effect size and conveying practical significance.",

		"abstract": "The present article considers a fundamental question in evaluation research: “By how much do program effects vary across sites?” The article ﬁrst presents a theoretical model of cross-site impact variation and a related estimation model with a random treatment coefﬁcient and ﬁxed site-speciﬁc intercepts. This approach eliminates several biases that can arise from unbalanced sample designs for multisite randomized trials. The article then describes how the approach operates, explores its assumptions, and applies the approach to data from three large welfare-to-work trials. The article also illustrates how to report cross-site impact ﬁndings and presents diagnostics for assessing these ﬁndings. To keep the article manageable, it focuses on experimental estimates of effects of program assignment (effects of intent to treat), although the ideas presented can be extended to analyses of multisite quasi-experiments and experimental estimates of effects of program participation (complier average causal effects).",

		"abstract": "Multisite trials, which are being used with increasing frequency in education and evaluation research, provide an exciting opportunity for learning about how the effects of interventions or programs are distributed across sites. In particular, these studies can produce rigorous estimates of a cross-site mean effect of program assignment (intent-to-treat), a cross-site standard deviation of the effects of program assignment, and a difference between the cross-site mean effects of program assignment for two subpopulations of sites. However, to capitalize on this opportunity will require adequately powering future trials to estimate these parameters. To help researchers do so, we present a simple approach for computing the minimum detectable values of these parameters for different sample designs. The article then uses this approach to illustrate for each parameter, the precision trade-off between increasing the number of study sites and increasing site sample size. Findings are presented for multisite trials that randomize individual sample members and for multisite trials that randomize intact groups or clusters of sample members.",

		"abstract": "This paper provides operational procedures for coding internationally comparable\nmeasures of occupational status from the recently published International Standard\nClassification of Occupation 1988 (ISCO88) of the International Labor Office (ILO, 1990).\nWe first discuss the nature of the ISCO88 classification and its relationship to national\nclassifications used around the world and also to its predecessor, ISCO68 (ILO, 1969),\nwhich has been widely utilized in comparative research. We argue that comparative\nresearch would gain much from adopting ISCO88 as the standard tool of classification and\nprovide guidance on how to do this. We then outline the procedures we have used to\ngenerate new standard recodes for three internationally comparable measures of occupational\nstatus: Treiman’s Standard International Occupational Prestige Scale (SIOPS),\nGanzeboom et al.’s International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI),\nand Erikson and Goldthorpe’s class categories (EGP). To update the SIOPS prestige scores\nwe have directly matched the occupational titles in the SIOPS scale to the categories of the\nISCO88 classification. For ISEI scores we have replicated the procedure used to create\nscores for the ISCO68 categories, employing the same data but using newly developed\nmatches between the underlying national occupational classifications and ISCO88. To\nconstruct the EGP class codes we have mapped the ISCO88 occupation categories into a 10-category classification developed by the CASMIN project for a 12-country analysis. To\nvalidate these scales, we estimated parameters of a basic status-attainment model from an\nindependent source of data: the pooled file from the International Social Justice Project (a\nlarge international data file that combines data from sample surveys in 14 countries).\nEstimates based on occupational status scales derived from ISCO88 and ISCO68 are\nhighly similar",

Key design decisions include the sample size per site and the number of sites. To consider power implications, this article proposes a standardized hierarchical linear model and uses rules of thumb similar to those proposed by J. Cohen (1988) for small, medium, and large effect sizes and for small, medium, and large treatment-by-site variance. Optimal allocation of resources within and between sites as a function of variance components and costs at each level are also considered.

It concludes that a focus on rigorous experiments evaluating replicable programs and practices is essential to build confidence in educational research among policymakers and educators. However, new funding is needed for such experiments and there is still a need for correlational, descriptive, and other disciplined inquiry in education.

		"abstract": "Objective:Over the past two decades, the lack of reliable empirical evidence concerning the effectiveness of educational interventions has motivated a new wave of research in education in sub-Saharan Africa (and across most of the world) that focuses on impact evaluation through rigorous research designs such as experiments. Often these experiments draw on the random assignment of entire clusters, such as schools, to accommodate the multilevel structure of schooling and the theory of action underlying many school-based interventions. Planning effective and efficient school randomized studies, however, requires plausible values of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the variance explained by covariates during the design stage. The purpose of this study was to improve the planning of two-level school-randomized studies in sub-Saharan Africa by providing empirical estimates of the ICC and the variance explained by covariates for education outcomes in 15 countries.Method:Our investigation drew on large-scale representative samples of sixth-grade students in 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and includes over 60,000 students across 2,500 schools. We examined two core education outcomes: standardized achievement in reading and mathematics. We estimated a series of two-level hierarchical linear models with students nested within schools to inform the design of two-level school-randomized trials.Results:The analyses suggested that outcomes were substantially clustered within schools but that the magnitude of the clustering varied considerably across countries. Similarly, the results indicated that covariance adjustment generally reduced clustering but that the prognostic value of such adjustment varied across countries.",

Untersuchbar werden sollen beispielsweise Fragen dazu, wie sich Kompetenzen über den Lebenslauf entwickeln, wie sie sich durch Einflüsse der Lernumwelten in der Familie, durch Bildungseinrichtungen, am Arbeitsplatz und im Privatleben verändern und welche Erträge von schulischen Bildungsprozessen im Lebensverlauf nachweisbar sind. Hierzu werden im NEPS Stichproben von Personen aus insgesamt sechs (Start-)Kohorten (Neugeborene, Kindergartenkinder, Fünftklässler, Neuntklässler, Studierende und Erwachsene) längsschnittlich untersucht und in regelmäßigen Abständen mit eigens entwickelten Testverfahren in verschiedenen Kompetenzbereichen untersucht. Die ausgewählten Kompetenzbereiche sollen dabei sowohl für ein erfolgreiches, verantwortungsvolles individuelles Leben bedeutsam sein, als auch für eine moderne demokratische Gesellschaft insgesamt. Die Lesekompetenz ist eine der erhobenen Kompetenzen. (DIPF/Orig.).",

Comer schools implemented more program details than the controls but were not faithful to all program particulars. Students' ratings of the school's social climate improved soon after the program began. By the last 2 study years, both the students' and teachers' perceptions of the school's academic climate had also improved relative to the control schools. By these last years, Comer schools had gained about 3 percentile points more than the controls in both reading and math and students reported less acting out on a scale whose items are correlated with more serious offending in later life. Students in Comer schools also endorsed more conventional norms about misbehaving and reported greater ability to control their anger. However, the Comer program did not benefit either students' mental health or their participation in activities that adults consider wholesome. Explanations for the achievement and acting out results are offered based on student and staff data about school climate, on insights from an ethnography conducted in the program schools, and on contrast with the evaluation results from Prince George's County MD, where a different variant of the program failed to achieve any positive outcomes.",

		"abstract": "This paper provides practical guidance for researchers who are designing studies that randomize groups to measure the impacts of interventions on children. To do so, the paper: (1) provides new empirical information about the values of parameters that influence the precision of impact estimates (intra-class correlations and R-squares); (2) examines the implications of planning group-randomized studies for three-level hierarchical situations, using empirical information obtained by estimating two-level hierarchical models (which under many conditions appears to not be problematic); and (3) assesses the implications of the uncertainty that exists when the design of group-randomized studies is based on estimates of intra-class correlations. Data for the paper come from two studies: the Chicago Literacy Initiative: Making Better Early Readers study (CLIMBERs) and the School Break-fast Pilot Project (SBPP). The analysis sample from CLIMBERs comprised 430 4-year old children from 47 preschool classrooms in 23 Chicago public schools. The analysis sample from the SBPP study comprised 1,151 third-graders from 233 classrooms in 111 schools in six school districts. Four appendixes are included: (1) Description of Outcome Measures; (2) Definition of the Multiplier M; (3) Complete Set of Results for Three-Level vs. Two-Level Model Comparisons: Nonstandardized Unconditional Variance Components; and (4) Proofs of the Relationship between Three-Level Models and Two-Level Models in Terms of Precision.

We argue that public-use aggregate school-level achievement data are, in fact, sufficient to address a wide range of evaluation questions and the use of this data is more appropriate than commonly thought. Specifically, we explore (a) when point estimates and standard errors differ between models that use individual student-level data and those that use aggregate school-level data, (b) the potential for conducting subgroup and nonexperimental analyses with aggregate data, and (c) the metrics that are currently available in state public-use data sets and the implications these have for analyses.",

		"abstract": "One of the major story lines of the growth of civilization is the advance of the experiment. From the food we eat to the diseases we conquer to our understanding of how we think and behave, we have profited enormously from an approach that marries our models of the world with tests of their validity through systematic variation to determine cause and effect. These same tools of thought and action are no less critical to the advance of education than to medicine, agriculture, psychology, or transportation. There has been impressive growth in the use of experimental methods in education over the past decade. As a result, much more is known today about what works and what does not. Future progress will be enhanced by research that better explicates process: linking trials to administrative data; serving the interest of local and state officials in examining the impact of their policies and practices; better preservice training for education practitioners in the logic and value of rigorous research; and more generous federal funding for the research enterprise.",

		"abstract": "The calculation and use of effect sizes—such as d for mean differences and r for correlations—has increased dramatically in second language (L2) research in the last decade. Interpretations of these effects, however, have been rare and, when present, have largely defaulted to Cohen's levels of small (d = .2, r = .1), medium (.5, .3), and large (.8, .5), which were never intended as prescriptions but rather as a general guide. As Cohen himself and many others have argued, effect sizes are best understood when interpreted within a particular discipline or domain. This article seeks to promote more informed and field-specific interpretations of d and r by presenting a description of L2 effects from 346 primary studies and 91 meta-analyses (N > 604,000). Results reveal that Cohen's benchmarks generally underestimate the effects obtained in L2 research. Based on our analysis, we propose a field-specific scale for interpreting effect sizes, and we outline eight key considerations for gauging relative magnitude and practical significance in primary and secondary studies, such as theoretical maturity in the domain, the degree of experimental manipulation, and the presence of publication bias.",

Less is known about parameters important for assessing differential impacts.Objectives:This article develops a statistical framework for designing CRTs to assess differences in impact among student subgroups and presents initial estimates of critical parameters.Research design:Effect sizes and minimum detectable effect sizes for average and differential impacts are calculated before and after conditioning on effects of covariates using results from several CRTs. Relative sensitivities to detect average and differential impacts are also examined.Subjects:Student outcomes from six CRTs are analyzed.Measures:Achievement in math, science, reading, and writing.Results:The ratio of between-cluster variation in the slope of the moderator divided by total variance?the ?moderator gap variance ratio??is important for designing studies to detect differences in impact between student subgroups. This quantity is the analogue of the intraclass correlation coefficient. Typical values were .02 for gender and .04 for socioeconomic status. For studies considered, in many cases estimates of differential impact were larger than of average impact, and after conditioning on effects of covariates, similar power was achieved for detecting average and differential impacts of the same size.Conclusions:Measuring differential impacts is important for addressing questions of equity, generalizability, and guiding interpretation of subgroup impact findings. Adequate power for doing this is in some cases reachable with CRTs designed to measure average impacts. Continuing collection of parameters for assessing differential impacts is the next step.",

The effect of sample weights on sampling errors is examined, as well as the effect of clustering of children in a sample of women who are the actual respondents in DHS surveys. Modelling of design effect for geographic domains, for subclasses that are defined in terms of individual characteristics, and for differences between subclasses is offered. At the country level, overall design effect (the ratio of actual to simple random sampling standard error) averaged over all variables and countries is around 1.5. Variation among countries is high, but less so than among variables. Urban-rural and regional differentials is design effects are small, and can be attributed to the fact that similar sample designs and cluster sizes were used across those domains within each country. Design effects for estimates over other subclasses are smaller, and tend towards 1.0 for small subclasses and differences, apart from the effect of sample weights which tends to persist undiminished across variables and subclasses. /// A partir de 48 enquêtes nationales réalisées par le programme DHS, les auteurs étudient, dans cet article, les effets de grappes calculés sur un grand nombre de varibles, au niveau de l'échantillon total ainsi que pour plusieurs domaines et sous-classes. L'effet des taux de pondération sur les erreurs de sondage a aussi été étudié. Par ailleurs, les auteurs examinent l'effet sur les erreurs de sondage résultant du fait que les enfants sont regroupés dans des grappes parce qu'ils sont issus des femmes de l'échantillon, qui sont les vraies enquêtées. Un modèle est présenté dans cet article pour estimer les effets de grappes pour les sous-classes qui sont définies en termes de caractéristiques individuelles plutôt qu'en termes de domaines géographiques. Au niveau des pays, l'effet global de grappes a une moyenne d'environ 1,5 sur toutes les variables et tous les pays. La variation parmi les pays est élevée mais moins élevée parmi les variables. La différence urbain-rural est très faible; elle pourrait être associée au fait que des plans de sondage et des tailles de grappe similaires ont été utilisés dans les deux domaines.",

An ITS design with a single treatment group assumes that the pretest functional form can be validly estimated and extrapolated into the postintervention period where it provides a valid counterfactual. This assumption is problematic. Ambiguous preintervention functional forms are common, as are other factors affecting posttest means and slopes. Using No Child Left Behind as an example, we demonstrate how adding multiple design elements to the basic ITS structure serves to promote causal inference by limiting alternative interpretations. No added design element is perfect by itself, but we argue that they collectively provide a strong causal warrant when the predictions they engender are complex, the results “cohere” with the predictions, and no alternative can fit the same pattern of predictions even if it can fit some of them.",

Some persistent problems in the measurement of school effects are identified: specifically, measurement error, specification in relevant levels, and the choice of covariates.

This paper presents a conceptual framework for research on such variation in program effects and the sources of this variation. The framework is intended to help researchers — both those who focus mainly on studying program implementation and those who focus mainly on estimating program effects — see how their respective pieces fit together in a way that helps to identify factors that explain variation in program effects and thereby support more systematic data collection on these factors. The ultimate goal of the framework is to enable researchers to offer better guidance to policymakers and program operators on the conditions and practices that are associated with larger and more positive effects.",

		"abstract": "In multilevel modeling, group-level variables (L2) for assessing contextual effects are frequently generated by aggregating variables from a lower level (L1). A major problem of contextual analyses in the social sciences is that there is no error-free measurement of constructs. In the present article, 2 types of error occurring in multilevel data when estimating contextual effects are distinguished: unreliability that is due to measurement error and unreliability that is due to sampling error. The fact that studies may or may not correct for these 2 types of error can be translated into a 2 × 2 taxonomy of multilevel latent contextual models comprising 4 approaches: an uncorrected approach, partial correction approaches correcting for either measurement or sampling error (but not both), and a full correction approach that adjusts for both sources of error. It is shown mathematically and with simulated data that the uncorrected and partial correction approaches can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects, depending on the number of L1 individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the number of indicators, and the size of the factor loadings. However, the simulation study also shows that partial correction approaches can outperform full correction approaches when the data provide only limited information in terms of the L2 construct (i.e., small number of groups, low intraclass correlation). A real-data application from educational psychology is used to illustrate the different approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)",

Using a cross-classified multilevel model with 5 levels (school, teacher, class, student, subject), the authors found little or no support for this contention. In general (except in terms of anxiety and persistence), girls were better motivated than boys, and these differences tended to generalize over student age and school subject in classes taught by both male and female teachers. Student perceptions of classroom climate were more specific to the group of students within a particular class than to the teacher who taught the class and had moderate to large effects on the motivation of individual students. The surprisingly small amounts of variance explained in motivation by student gender and age, teacher gender, school subject, and their interactions support a gender invariance and similarities model but not theoretical predictions based on gender stereotype, gender intensification, and gender matching perspectives.

		"abstract": "This article explores the possibility of randomly assigning groups (or clusters) of individuals to a program or a control group to estimate the impacts of programs designed to affect whole groups. This cluster assignment approach maintains the primary strength of random assignment—the provision of unbiased impact estimates—but has less statistical power than random assignment of individuals, which usually is not possible for programs focused on whole groups. To explore the statistical implications of cluster assignment, the authors (a) outline the issues involved, (b) present an analytic framework for studying these issues, and (c) apply this framework to assess the potential for using the approach to evaluate education programs targeted on whole schools. The findings suggest that cluster assignment of schools holds some promise for estimating the impacts of education programs when it is possible to control for the average performance of past student cohorts or the past performance of individual students.",

		"abstract": "The goal of the present paper is to introduce education researchers to a new\napproach for measuring the impacts of whole-school reforms. The approach is based on\ninterrupted time-series analysis, which has been used to evaluate programs in many fields\nbut has not been used widely to study education initiatives. The application presented\nmeasures program impacts on student performance by comparing standardized test scores\nfor a number of annual student cohorts in a specific grade after a reform is launched (its\nfollow-up period) with the scores of cohorts from several years before the reform was\nlaunched (its baseline period). The approach is used to measure impacts on three facets of\nstudent performance: (1) average (mean) test scores, which summarize impacts on total\nperformance; (2) the distribution of scores across specific ranges, which helps to identify\nwhere in the distribution of student performance impacts were experienced; and (3) the\nvariation (standard deviation) of scores, which indicates how the disparity in student\nperformance was affected. To help researchers use the approach, the paper lays out its\nconceptual rationale, describes its statistical procedures, explains how to interpret its\nfindings, indicates its strengths and limitations and illustrates how it was used to evaluate\na major whole-school reform model—Accelerated Schools.",

However, there is confusion in the literature on the definition of effect size, and consequently the term is used inconsistently. We propose a definition for effect size, discuss 3 facets of effect size (dimension, measure/index, and value), outline 10 corollaries that follow from our definition, and review ideal qualities of effect sizes. Our definition of effect size is general and subsumes many existing definitions of effect size. We define effect size as a quantitative reflection of the magnitude of some phenomenon that is used for the purpose of addressing a question of interest. Our definition of effect size is purposely more inclusive than the way many have defined and conceptualized effect size, and it is unique with regard to linking effect size to a question of interest. Additionally, we review some important developments in the effect size literature and discuss the importance of accompanying an effect size with an interval estimate that acknowledges the uncertainty with which the population value of the effect size has been estimated. We hope that this article will facilitate discussion and improve the practice of reporting and interpreting effect sizes.",

The necessary data was collected to achieve the study aims.Results of the study showed that about (26%) of the hypotheses contained a small effect size, and the average for (T- test) was (0.37), while the average for (F- test)\nwas (0.13). Also, results revealed that around (63%) of the selected hypotheses had a weak statistical power test, around (11%) of the hypotheses had a medium statistical power test, and a round (26%) of the hypotheses had a large statistical power test.

		"abstract": "Between‐community variance or community‐by‐time variance is one of the key factors driving the cost of conducting group randomized trials, which are often very expensive. We investigated empirically whether between‐community variance could be reduced by controlling individual‐ and/or community‐level covariates and identified these covariates from four large community‐based group randomized trials or surveys: the Working Well Trial; Kaiser Adolescent Survey; Kaiser Adults Survey; and the Eating Patterns Study. We found that adjusting for covariates will often substantially reduce the between‐community variance component. Therefore investigators could block the communities according to these covariates, or adjust for these covariates to improve the power of community trials. We found that the community‐by‐time variance components are always near zero in these data sets, especially for the surveys where a cohort was followed over time. The covariate adjustment had less impact on reducing the community‐by‐time variance for the cohort samples than for the cross‐sectional samples. This suggests that blocking may not be necessary for the design of the group randomized trials where the change from baseline is of primary interest. The Working Well Trial data were used to illustrate this point. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

However, there is not much information available about the design and analysis strategies for these kinds of trials. Approaches to sample size and power calculations have been provided, but a simple sample size formula is lacking. Therefore, our aim is to provide a sample size formula for cluster randomized stepped wedge designs. Study Design and Setting: We derived a design effect (sample size correction factor) that can be used to estimate the required sample size for stepped wedge designs. Furthermore, we compared the required sample size for the stepped wedge design with a parallel group and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) design.\nResults: Our formula corrects for clustering as well as for the design. Apart from the cluster size and intracluster correlation, the design effect depends on choices of the number of steps, the number of baseline measurements, and the number of measurements between steps. The stepped wedge design requires a substantial smaller sample size than a parallel group and ANCOVA design.\nConclusion: For CRTs, the stepped wedge design is far more efﬁcient than the parallel group and ANCOVA design in terms of sample size.",

Design Review of 34 cluster randomised trials in primary care published in 2004 and 2005 in seven journals (British Medical Journal, British Journal of General Practice, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics). Data sources National Library of Medicine (Medline) via PubMed. Data extraction To assess aspects of internal validity we extracted data on appropriateness of sample size calculations and analyses, methods of identifying and recruiting individual participants, and blinding. To explore reporting of information useful in assessing external validity we extracted data on cluster eligibility, cluster inclusion and retention, cluster generalisability, and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to health providers in clusters.\nResults 21 (62%) trials accounted for clustering in sample size calculations and 30 (88%) in the analysis; about a quarter were potentially biased because of procedures surrounding recruitment and identification of patients; individual participants were blind to allocation status in 19 (56%) and outcome assessors were blind in 15 (44%). In almost half the reports, information relating to generalisability of clusters was poorly reported, and in two fifths there was no information about the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.\nConclusions Cluster randomised trials are essential for evaluating certain types of interventions. Issues affecting their internal validity, such as appropriate sample size calculations and analysis, have been widely disseminated and are now better addressed by researchers. Blinding of those identifying and recruiting patients to allocation status is recommended but is not always carried out. There may be fewer barriers to internal validity in trials in which individual participants are not recruited. External validity seems poorly addressed in many trials, yet is arguably as important as internal validity in judging quality as a basis for healthcare intervention.",

Randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs are promoted to measure ‘impact’. Recent debates about this reﬂect longer standing methodological disputes. Advocates of comparative approaches contend that these are uniquely capable of establishing causality. However, others dispute this and consider their application in education as often being ﬂawed.

Because statistical power for continuous outcomes is well known, a natural question is whether power may be estimated in a similar way for the case of binary outcomes. This question involves establishing the appropriate analogy between design parameters in the continuous and binary outcome cases, which consists of an analogy in effect sizes and an analogy in the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). This article proposes two possible analogies for the ICC and discusses the challenges in establishing a valid and useful analogy for statistical power in designs with binary outcomes. Using the results from two simulation studies, we compare the power estimates and Type I error rates under two analytic models for binary outcomes and the corresponding values under the ICC analogies. We use the simulation results to assess the implications for power and statistical inference when no useful analogy in ICCs exists for a given study. We provide a discussion on how researchers might think of the analogies using an empirical example on a preschool intervention in Ghana. We conclude with final thoughts on the limitations in establishing an analogy in design parameters and ideas for future research.",

Methods for the estimation of power in two-level models have been based on formulas and Monte Carlo simulation. We provide a hands-on tutorial illustrating how a priori and post hoc power analyses for the most frequently used two-level models are conducted. We describe how a population model for the power analysis can be specified by using standardized input parameters and how the power analysis is implemented in SIMR, a very flexible power estimation method based on Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we provide case-sensitive rules of thumb for deriving sufficient sample sizes as well as minimum detectable effect sizes that yield a power Ն .80 for the effects and input parameters most frequently analyzed by psychologists. For medium variance components, the results indicate that with lower level (L1) sample sizes up to 30 and higher level (L2) sample sizes up to 200, medium and large fixed effects can be detected. However, small L2 director cross-level interaction effects cannot be detected with up to 200 clusters. The tutorial and guidelines should be of help to researchers dealing with multilevel study designs such as individuals clustered within groups or repeated measurements clustered within individuals.",

		"abstract": "Mathematics professional development is widely offered, typically with the goal of improving teachers’ content knowledge, the quality of teaching, and ultimately students’ achievement. Recently, new assessments focused on mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) have been developed to assist in the evaluation and improvement of mathematics professional development. This study presents empirical estimates of average program change in MKT and its variation with the goal of supporting the design of experimental trials that are adequately powered to detect a specified program effect. The study drew on a large database representing five different assessments of MKT and collectively 326 professional development programs and 9,365 teachers. Results from cross-classified hierarchical growth models found that standardized average change estimates across the five assessments ranged from a low of 0.16 standard deviations (SDs) to a high of 0.26 SDs. Power analyses using the estimated pre- and posttest change estimates indicated that hundreds of teachers are needed to detect changes in knowledge at the lower end of the distribution. Even studies powered to detect effects at the higher end of the distribution will require substantial resources to conduct rigorous experimental trials. Empirical benchmarks that describe average program change and its variation provide a useful preliminary resource for interpreting the relative magnitude of effect sizes associated with professional development programs and for designing adequately powered trials.",

Using estimates based on roughly 300 million test score records in math and English Language Arts (ELA) for Grades 3 through 8 from every U.S. public school district during the 2008–09 to 2014–15 school years, we estimate intraclass correlations (ICCs) as a measure of between-district variation. We characterize the variation in the ICCs across states as well as the patterns in the ICCs over subjects, grades, and cohorts. Further, we investigate the relationship between the ICCs and measures of racial and socioeconomic segregation. We find that between-district variation is greatest, on average, in states with high levels of both White-Black and economic segregation.",

Yet, further research is warranted to understand better how such interventions should be designed in order to be successfully implemented in the classroom setting. A cluster randomized controlled study was conducted to test whether ninth-grade students' value beliefs for mathematics (i.e., intrinsic value, attainment value, utility value, and cost) could be fostered with relevance interventions in the classroom. Eighty-two classrooms were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental conditions or a waiting control condition. Both experimental groups received a 90-min intervention within the classroom on the relevance of mathematics, consisting of a psychoeducational presentation and relevance-inducing tasks (either writing a text or evaluating interview quotations). Intervention effects were evaluated via self-reports of 1,916 participating students 6 weeks and 5 months after the intervention in the classroom. Both intervention conditions fostered more positive value beliefs among students at both time points. Compared with the control condition, classes in the quotations condition reported higher utility value, attainment value, and intrinsic value, and classes in the text condition reported higher utility value. Thus, stronger effects on students' value beliefs were found for the quotations condition than for the text condition. When assessing intervention effects separately for females and males, some evidence for stronger effects for females than for males was found.",

Via a meta-analysis we examine 51 studies in which interventions aimed to enhance student learning by improving student use of either one or a combination of learning or study skills. Such interventions typically focused on task-related skills, self-management of learning, or affective components such as motivation and self-concept. Using the SOLO model (Biggs & Collis, 1982), we categorized the interventions (a) into four hierarchical levels of structural complexity and (b) as either near or far in terms of transfer. The results support the notion of situated cognition, whereby it is recommended that training other than for simple mnemonic performance should be in context, use tasks within the same domain as the target content, and promote a high degree of learner activity and metacognitive awareness.",

IRR and IRA indices are often used to justify aggregating lower-level data used in composition models. The purpose of the current article is to expose researchers to the various issues surrounding the use of IRR and IRA indices often used in conjunction with multilevel models.

Additionally, we emphasize interpreting and reporting unstandardized effect sizes because of common misconceptions regarding standardized effect sizes which we elucidate. Effect sizes should directly answer their motivating research questions, be comprehensible to the average reader, and be based on meaningful metrics of their constituent variables. We illustrate our recommendations with empirical examples involving a One-way ANOVA, a categorical variable analysis, an interaction effect in linear regression, and a simple mediation model, emphasizing the interpretation of effect sizes.

		"abstract": "Multiple imputation is a widely recommended means of addressing the problem of missing data in psychological research. An often-neglected requirement of this approach is that the imputation model used to generate the imputed values must be at least as general as the analysis model. For multilevel designs in which lower level units (e.g., students) are nested within higher level units (e.g., classrooms), this means that the multilevel structure must be taken into account in the imputation model. In the present article, we compare different strategies for multiply imputing incomplete multilevel data using mathematical derivations and computer simulations. We show that ignoring the multilevel structure in the imputation may lead to substantial negative bias in estimates of intraclass correlations as well as biased estimates of regression coefficients in multilevel models. We also demonstrate that an ad hoc strategy that includes dummy indicators in the imputation model to represent the multilevel structure may be problematic under certain conditions (e.g., small groups, low intraclass correlations). Imputation based on a multivariate linear mixed effects model was the only strategy to produce valid inferences under most of the conditions investigated in the simulation study. Data from an educational psychology research project are also used to illustrate the impact of the various multiple imputation strategies.

		"abstract": "Factorial experimental designs have many potential advantages for behavioral scientists. For example, such designs may be useful in building more potent interventions by helping investigators to screen several candidate intervention components simultaneously and to decide which are likely to offer greater benefit before evaluating the intervention as a whole. However, sample size and power considerations may challenge investigators attempting to apply such designs, especially when the population of interest is multilevel (e.g., when students are nested within schools, or when employees are nested within organizations). In this article, we examine the feasibility of factorial experimental designs with multiple factors in a multilevel, clustered setting (i.e., of multilevel, multifactor experiments). We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate how design elements—such as the number of clusters, the number of lower-level units, and the intraclass correlation—affect power. Our results suggest that multilevel, multifactor experiments are feasible for factor-screening purposes because of the economical properties of complete and fractional factorial experimental designs. We also discuss resources for sample size planning and power estimation for multilevel factorial experiments. These results are discussed from a resource management perspective, in which the goal is to choose a design that maximizes the scientific benefit using the resources available for an investigation.

We propose the use of propensity-score-based metrics to quantify the similarity of the participants in a randomized trial and a target population. In this setting the propensity score model predicts participation in the randomized trial, given a set of covariates. The resulting propensity scores are used first to quantify the difference between the trial participants and the target population, and then to match, subclassify, or weight the control group outcomes to the population, assessing how well the propensity score-adjusted outcomes track the outcomes actually observed in the population. These metrics can serve as a first step in assessing the generalizability of results from randomized trials to target populations. This paper lays out these ideas, discusses the assumptions underlying the approach, and illustrates the metrics using data on the evaluation of a schoolwide prevention program called Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports.",

		"abstract": "Zusammenfassung. Die Idee einer dezidierten wissenschaftlichen Orientierung der Lehramtsausbildung und der pädagogischen Praxis ist nicht neu. Relativ neu ist hingegen die Inanspruchnahme des Evidenzbegriffs und, oft im selben Atemzug, der Blick auf evidenzbasierte Medizin, der in Fragen evidenzbasierter Praxis eine Vorreiterrolle zugeschrieben wird. Der Evidenzbegriff ist schillernd und bringt einige Probleme mit sich. Zudem lassen sich in Bezug auf die Interpretation und Anwendung des Evidenzbegriffs verschiedene Paradigmen ausmachen. Im deutschsprachigen Raum überwiegt eine Evidenzperspektive, die im Vergleich zur vorherrschenden US-amerikanischen Variante einen liberalen Methodenpluralismus pflegt und evidenzbasierte Praxis als Spezialfall einer evidenzorientierten oder -informierten Praxis auffasst. In der Konsequenz werden pädagogischer und psychologischer Evidenz, um die es in diesem Beitrag geht, in Bezug auf pädagogische Praxis v.a. evaluative und reflexive Funktionen zugesprochen. Dennoch steht die Anwendung wissenschaftlichen Wissens in der pädagogischen Praxis vor Problemen, die nicht zuletzt durch die fragwürdige Qualität der wissenschaftlichen Wissensbasis bedingt sind. Zudem ergeben sich zwangsläufig Passungs- und Transferprobleme, die auch die elaborierte Technologiekonzeption von Theo Herrmann nicht überwinden konnte. Umso höher sind die Anforderungen, die evidenzorientiertes pädagogisches Handeln an bildungswissenschaftliche Forschungskompetenz sowie Kompetenzen der Integration von wissenschaftlichem Wissen und pädagogischem Erfahrungswissen an Lehrkräfte stellt. Diese Kompetenzen gilt es, bereits in der universitären Lehramtsausbildung systematisch zu fördern.",

		"abstract": "Although the simple view of reading and other theories suggest that listening comprehension is an important determinant of reading comprehension, previous research on linguistic transfer has mainly focused on the role of first language (L1) decoding skills in second language (L2) reading. The present study tested the assumption that listening comprehension in L1 is a significant predictor of language minority students’ reading comprehension in L2. In addition, we explored whether the cross-linguistic relationship is particularly pronounced at higher levels of L1 proficiency. The sample included 502 9th grade students with Russian as L1 and 662 9th grade students with Turkish as L1 from a nationwide study conducted in Germany. The L1s of these students differ in their similarity to their L2, German: Russian is considerably more similar to German than is Turkish. In both language groups, L1 listening comprehension significantly predicted L2 reading comprehension in linear regression models; this was also true after important control variables were taken into account. Polynomial regression models indicated that the relationship between L1 proficiency and L2 proficiency was linear in the Russian sample, yet stronger at higher levels of L1 proficiency in the Turkish sample. Thus, the prediction that transfer should be more pronounced at higher levels of L1 proficiency was also partly supported. Our study extends the range of L1 skills previously known to transfer to L2 reading. We found the predicted relationship between L1 listening comprehension and L2 reading comprehension in 2 language groups with varying degrees of language similarity, suggesting that the effect is language-independent.

		"abstract": "Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) have become a central component of school psychology research and practice, but EBIs are dependent upon the availability and use of evidence-based assessments (EBAs) with diverse student populations. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) is an analytical tool that can be used to examine the validity and measurement equivalence/invariance of scores across diverse groups. The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual and procedural overview of categorical MG-CFA, as well as an illustrated example based on data from the Social and Academic Behavior Risk Screener (SABRS) – a tool designed for use in school-based interventions. This article serves as a non-technical primer on the topic of MG-CFA with ordinal (rating scale) data and does so through the framework of examining equivalence of measures used for EBIs within multi-tiered models – an understudied topic. To go along with the illustrated example, we have provided supplementary files that include sample data, Mplus input code, and an annotated guide for understanding the input code (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2016.11.002). Data needed to reproduce analyses in this article are available as supplemental materials (online only) in the Appendix of this article.",

Little is known about how design parameters compare across other educational outcomes.\nObjectives: This article presents empirical estimates of design parameters that can be used to appropriately power CRTs in science education and compares them to estimates using mathematics and reading.\nResearch Design: Estimates of intraclass correlations (ICCs) are computed for unconditional two-level (students in schools) and three-level (students in schools in districts) hierarchical linear models of science achievement. Relevant student- and school-level pretest and demographic covariates are then considered, and estimates of variance explained are computed. Subjects: Five consecutive years of Texas student-level data for Grades 5, 8, 10, and 11.\nMeasures: Science, mathematics, and reading achievement raw scores as measured by the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills. Results: Findings show that ICCs in science range from .172 to .196 across grades and are generally higher than comparable statistics in mathematics, .163–.172, and reading, .099–.156. When available, a 1-year lagged student-level science pretest explains the most variability in the outcome. The 1-year lagged school-level science pretest is the best alternative in the absence of a 1-year lagged student-level science pretest.\nConclusion: Science educational researchers should utilize design parameters derived from science achievement outcomes.",

		"abstract": "Numerous authors have reviewed research to determine which skills are considered fundamental to successful academic and social outcomes for students (Hattie, Briggs, & Purdie, 1996; Masten & Coatworth, 1998; Wang, Haertel, & Walberg, 1994; Zins, Weissberg, Wang, & Walberg, 2004). These skills include: (1) cognitive and meta-cognitive skills such as goal setting, progress monitoring, organization and memory skills; (2) social skills such as interpersonal, social problem-solving, listening, and team-work skills; and (3) self-management skills such as managing attention, motivation, and anger. If students are taught these fundamental cognitive, social, and self-management skills in a caring, supportive, and encouraging environment where they feel safe to take risks as they try new strategies, their confidence in their abilities increases, as does their effort in the classroom, eventually leading to improved academic outcomes. The Student Success Skills (SSS) classroom-based intervention was developed to systematically teach students fundamental social, emotional, and learning skills. The purpose of the project described here was to allow for rigorous research to evaluate both the proximal and distal outcomes resulting from classroom level student participation in SSS when facilitated by school counselors and reinforced by classroom teachers. Participants were 4,321 fifth grade students in 235 classrooms in 60 schools across two school districts (15 treatment and 15 control in each district). The study employed a hierarchical design, often referred to as a cluster-randomized design, where schools (i.e., clusters) were randomly assigned to either treatment or control conditions. Therefore, the unit of randomization was the school. Hierarchical Liner Modeling (HLM) results suggest that Student Success Skills (SSS) has a beneficial effect on student academic-related behavior. Specifically, these results suggest that participation in the SSS program resulted in lower levels of test anxiety, higher levels of engagement in classroom work, higher levels of appropriate assertion in classroom interactions, and higher levels of cooperation. In addition, participation in Student Success Skills prevented a rise in disruptive behavior over the school year that was observed in Control students. These results indicate that SSS enhanced students' ability to perform under pressure, increased students' motivated engagement in school-work, enhanced classroom social skills, and decreased students' disruptive behavior. Data analysis tables are appended.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this article is to identify and estimate the influence of educational, psychological, and social factors on learning. Using evidence accumulated from 61 research experts, 91 meta-analyses, and 179 handbook chapters and narrative reviews, the data for analysis represent over 11,000 relationships. Three methods—content analyses, expert ratings, and results from meta-analyses—are used to quantify the importance and consistency of variables that influence learning. Regardless of which method is employed, there is moderate to substantial agreement on the categories exerting the greatest influence on school learning as well as those that have less influence. The results suggest an emergent knowledge base for school learning. Generally, proximal variables (e.g., psychological, instructional, and home environment) exert more influence than distal variables (e.g., demographic, policy, and organizational). The robustness and consistency of the findings suggest they can be used to inform educational policies and practices.",

The author considers designs where random assignment is conducted at the school, classroom, or student level, and employs a unified analytic framework using statistical methods from the literature. Focusing on standardized test scores of elementary school students, this article discusses appropriate precision standards and, for each design, the required number of schools to achieve those standards using empirical values of intraclass correlations, regression R2 values, and other parameters. Clustering effects vary by design but are typically large. Thus, large school samples are required for education trials, and many evaluations will only have sufficient power to detect precise impacts for relatively large subgroups of sites.",

The study was relatively small scale (one site) and highly controlled. This replication was implemented at a much larger scale—in 76 schools in four urban districts; 994 at-risk students participated. Intervention students participated in approximately 30 hours of small-group work in addition to classroom instruction; control students received typical instruction and whatever assistance the teacher would normally provide.

These analyses are most likely to be valid when they are based on data from the jurisdictions in which the studies are to be conducted. In this method note, we provide software code, in the form of a SAS macro, for producing statistical power analyses using such data. The macro is designed to estimate statistical parameters for multiple school subjects and multiple grades in a single computer run. Among other convenient features, the macro calculates intraclass correlation coefficient confidence intervals, which are essential for planning studies conservatively. We also provide a SAS macro for calculating benchmarks–again, using locally-based–data for interpreting the feasibility of achieving the minimum detectable effect sizes that are calculated in statistical power analyses. The benchmarks are potentially useful for interpreting the meaning of the effect sizes that are achieved in completed studies, as well. We describe the macros, describe how we verified their accuracy, show how they can be useful to education evaluators, and give examples of their use with statewide educational assessment data. It is our hope that the macros will help evaluators use local data when conducting group-randomized studies.",

Empirical findings from five urban school districts indicate that (1) pretests can reduce the number of randomized schools needed for a given level of precision to about half of what would be needed otherwise for elementary schools, one fifth for middle schools, and one tenth for high schools, and (2) school-level pretests are as effective in this regard as student-level pretests. Furthermore, the precision-enhancing power of pretests (3) declines only slightly as the number of years between the pretest and posttests increases; (4) improves only slightly with pretests for more than 1 baseline year; and (5) is substantial, even when the pretest differs from the posttest.

The first approach characterizes the natural developmental progress in achievement made by students from one year to the next as effect sizes. Data for seven nationally standardized achievement tests show large annual gains in the early elementary grades followed by gradually declining gains in later grades. A given intervention effect will therefore look quite different when compared to the annual progress for different grade levels. The second approach explores achievement gaps for policy-relevant subgroups of students or schools. Data from national- and district-level achievement tests show that, when represented as effect sizes, student gaps are relatively small for gender and much larger for economic disadvantage and race/ethnicity. For schools, the differences between weak schools and average schools are surprisingly modest when expressed as student-level effect sizes. A given intervention effect viewed in terms of its potential for closing one of these performance gaps will therefore look very different depending on which gap is considered.",

Speciﬁcally, it compares the total number of clusters randomized and the minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of two sets of studies, those funded in the early years of IES (2002–2004) and those funded in the recent years (2011–2013). Overall, the average precision in terms of MDES of studies in the recent cohort was more than double that of the early cohort (i.e. 0.48 compared to 0.23). The ﬁndings suggest a consistent and substantial increase in the precision of CRTs funded by IES in the past decade which is a critical step towards designing studies that have the potential to yield high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of educational interventions.",

In this study, we provide methods for power analysis in three-level polynomial change models for cluster randomized designs (i.e., treatment assigned to units at the third level). Power computations take into account clustering effects at the second and third levels, the number of measurement occasions, the impact of sample sizes at different levels (e.g., number of schools or students), and covariates effects.

Furthermore, the researchers are interested in understanding and interpreting variability in treatment effects through moderation analysis as an approach to exploring the sources of the treatment effect variability. This study develops formulas for power analyses to detect the moderator effects in designing three-level cluster randomized trials (CRTs). We develop the statistical formulas for calculating statistical power, minimum detectable effect size difference, and 95% conﬁdence intervals for cluster or cross-level moderation, nonrandomly varying or random slopes, binary or continuous moderators, and designs with or without covariates. We demonstrate how the calculations can be used in the planning phase of three-level CRTs using the software PowerUp!-Moderator.",

A resulting consequence is that researchers conducting such trials are faced with a multitude of design choices, including selection of the primary unit of inference, the degree to which clusters should be matched or stratified by prognostic factors at baseline, and decisions related to cluster subsampling. Moreover, application of ethical principles developed for individually randomized trials may also require modification.\n\nWe discuss several topics related to these issues, with emphasis on the choices that must be made in the planning stages of a trial and on some potential pitfalls to be avoided.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this symposium is to present recent work aimed at improving the designand power analysesof impact studies of STEMinterventions. It is often the case that these impact studies utilizea cluster randomized trial (CRT) in which students are nested within teachers nested within schools. The outcomes of interest may be at the student level, such as science achievement, or at the teacher level, such as teacher pedagogical content knowledge or content knowledge. In order for these CRTsto yield rigorous evidence of whether an intervention has a treatment effect at the student and/or teacher level, it must be designed with adequate power to detect a meaningful effectat either/both levels. Thefirst paper in this symposium presents effect sizesfrom a meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental studies of interventions with preservice and inservice science teachers, in the U.S. and internationally. The second paper provides results from secondary analyses with 8 existing educational datasets that have at least one teacher outcome in math or science and reports estimates of the intraclass correlation (ICC), and the percent of variance explained by covariate(s) (R2). The empirically estimated design parameters (effect sizes, ICCs, R2s) from these two papers will help researchers planning CRTs of STEM interventions conduct more accurate power analysesfor teacher-level outcomes, which is critical given that lack of empirical estimates of design parameters for teacher-level outcomes. The third paper considers the design of CRTs that seek to impact both teacher outcomes and student outcomes in one study, such as an impact study that evaluates aSTEM professional development program. This paper integrates the findings from papers 1 and 2 as well as recent literature on design parameters for student outcomes to examine the alignment of the power analyses when a study seeks to examine the impact of a STEM intervention on both teacher and student effects.",

		"abstract": "The present study explored multilevel variance for a range of salient psycho-educational factors in mathematics. With a sample of 4,383 students (Years 5–8) in 257 classrooms and 47 schools, data indicated patterns of variance across the selection of psycho-educational factors. For all factors, the bulk of variance resided at the student (and residual) level. In ascending order of upper-level variance were motivation, perceived motivational ‘climate’, homework completion, teacher-student relationships, and achievement – with motivation and perceived ‘climate’ yielding very little upper-level variance. Hence, although there is usually a hierarchical structure in which psycho-educational factors are situated, there is variation in patterns of multilevel variance across the range of factors. In exploring a range of psycho-educational phenomena from a multilevel perspective, the present study offers further direction for researchers selecting and operationalizing psycho-educational phenomena in multilevel research. Implications for pedagogy, classroom climate, and separating teaching effects from teacher effects and schooling effects from school effects are also discussed.",

Multilevel models are used to describe the relationship between an outcome variable and a treatment condition and covariate. It is assumed that the outcome variable is measured on a continuous scale. As optimality criteria D-optimality, and L-optimality are chosen. It is shown that pre-stratiﬁcation on the covariate leads to a more eﬃcient design and that the person level is the optimal level of randomization. Furthermore, optimal sample sizes are given and it is shown that these do not depend on the optimality criterion when randomization is done at the group level.",

For the sampling variance of the intraclass correlation, it was shown by simulation that the commonly used expression, derived using a first-order Taylor series performs better than alternative expressions found in the literature, when the between-sire degrees of freedom were small. The expressions for the sampling variance of the genetic correlation are significantly biased for small sample sizes, in particular when the population values, or their estimates, are close to zero. It was shown, both analytically and by simulation, that this is because the estimate of the sampling variance becomes very large in these cases due to very small values of the denominator of the expressions. It was concluded, therefore, that for small samples, estimates of the heritabilities and genetic correlations should not be used in the expressions for the sampling variance of the genetic correlation. It was shown analytically that in cases where the population values of the heritabilities are known, using the estimated heritabilities rather than their true values to estimate the genetic correlation results in a lower sampling variance for the genetic correlation. Therefore, for large samples, estimates of heritabilities, and not their true values, should be used.",

The intervention proved to be more effective in the laboratory (g = 0.45) than the ﬁeld (g = 0.05) in enhancing subsequent motivation. We explored this reduction in treatment effectiveness through a ﬁdelity analysis that examined the extent to which participants responded to the treatment. We calculated ﬁdelity as three indices of achieved relative treatment strength (Cordray & Pion, 2006), and found that, regardless of how ﬁdelity was calculated, achieved relative strength was about 1 standard deviation less in the classroom than the laboratory. In addition, greater levels of achieved relative strength were associated with greater differences in the motivational outcome—indicating that intervention was more effective for participants who actually received the treatment than those who did not. Multilevel analyses indicated that the drop in classroom treatment ﬁdelity was partially because of teacher, rather than student, factors. Implications for theoretical models of change and research are discussed.",

To encourage an increased use of alternative measures of effect, the present paper discusses several measures of effect size that might be used in group comparison studies involving univariate and/or multivariate models. For the methods discussed, formulas are presented and data from an experimental study are used to demonstrate the application and interpretation of these indices.

Here, we discuss the role of social-emotional assessment tools in planning, implementing, and evaluating preventative strategies to promote mental health in all children and adolescents. We, first, selectively review existing tools and identify current gaps in the measurement literature. Next, we introduce the Holistic Student Assessment (HSA), a tool that is based in our social-emotional developmental theory, The Clover Model, and designed to measure social-emotional development in children and adolescents. Using a sample of 5946 students (51% boys, M age = 13.16 years), we provide evidence for the psychometric validity of the self-report version of the HSA. First, we document the theoretically expected 7-dimension factor structure in a calibration sub-sample (n = 984) and cross-validate its structure in a validation sub-sample (n = 4962). Next, we show measurement invariance across development, i.e., late childhood (9- to 11-year-olds), early adolescence (12- to 14-year-olds), and middle adolescence (15- to 18-year-olds), and evidence for the HSA’s construct validity in each age group. The findings support the robustness of the factor structure and confirm its developmental sensitivity. Structural equation modeling validity analysis in a multiple-group framework indicates that the HSA is associated with mental health in expected directions across ages. Overall, these findings show the psychometric properties of the tool, and we discuss how social-emotional tools such as the HSA can guide future research and inform large-scale dissemination of preventive strategies.",

The majority of studies included adults (age 18 and older) as participants, administered brief (less than 1 day) interventions, assessed intervention effects immediately following the intervention, and did not report treatment integrity. Most studies included multiple outcome measures and exhibited an increase in effect-size reporting from 4% in 1995 to 61% in 2004. The percentage of total articles based on randomized experiments decreased over the 21-year period in both the educational psychology journals (from 40% in 1983 to 34% in 1995 to 26% in 2004) and AERJ (from 33% to 17% to 4%).

In addition, current methodological issues in intervention research are highlighted, including advancements in methodology and statistical procedures, extended outcome assessments, replication studies, and a thorough examination of potential biases. We further discuss transfer-related issues, for example the need for more research on the flexibility and adaptability of programs and intervention approaches as well as more general problems in knowledge translation reasoning the need for enhanced communication between practitioners, policy makers, and researchers. Finally, we briefly touch on the need to discuss the relation between single intervention programs, the mental health system, and changes of contextual conditions at the macro level.",

Its focus is on essential problems and prospects for intervention research examining two related topics, i.e., methodological issues and research integrity, and challenges in the transfer of research knowledge into practice and policy. The main aims are to identify how to advance methodology in order to improve research quality, examine scientific integrity in the field of intervention science, and discuss future steps to enhance the transfer of knowledge about evidence-based intervention principles into sustained practice, routine activities, and policy decisions. Themes of the special issue are twofold. The first includes questions about research methodology in intervention science, both in terms of research design and methods, as well as data analyses and the reporting of findings. Second, the issue tackles questions surrounding the types of knowledge translation frameworks that might be beneficial to mobilize the transfer of research-based knowledge into practice and public policies. The issue argues that innovations in methodology and thoughtful approaches to knowledge translation can enable transparency, quality, and sustainability of intervention research.",

Key aspects of the design in these cluster-randomized experiments involve knowledge of the intraclass correlation structure, the effect size, and the sample sizes necessary to achieve adequate power to detect the treatment effect. However, the units at each level of the hierarchy have a cost associated with them and thus researchers need to decide on sample sizes given a certain budget, when designing their studies. This article provides methods for computing power within an optimal design framework that incorporates costs of units in all three levels for three-level cluster-randomized balanced designs with two levels of nesting at the second and third level. The optimal sample sizes are a function of the variances at each level and the cost of each unit. Overall, larger effect sizes, smaller intraclass correlations at the second and third level, and lower cost of Level 3 and Level 2 units result in higher estimates of power.",

		"abstract": "Evidence-based intervention programs have become highly important in recent years, especially in educational contexts. However, transferring these programs into practice and into the wider field of public policy often fails. As a consequence, the field of implementation research has emerged, several implementation frameworks have been developed, and implementation studies conducted. However, intervention research and implementation research have not yet been connected systematically and different traditions and research groups are involved. Implementation researchers are mostly given mandates by politicians to take on the implementation of already existing interventions. This might be one of the key reasons why there are still many problems in translating programs into widespread community practice. In this paper, we argue for a systematic integration of intervention and implementation research (“I3-Approach”) and recommend a six-step procedure (PASCIT). This requires researchers to design and develop intervention programs using a field-oriented and participative approach. In particular, the perspective of policymakers has to be included as well as an analysis of which factors support or hinder evidence-based policy in contrast to opinion-based policy. How this systematic connection between intervention and implementation research can be realized, is illustrated by means of the development and implementation of the ViSC school program, which intends to reduce aggressive behavior and bullying and to foster social and intercultural competencies.",

Although both of these statistics are substantively and methodologically important, only the ﬁrst has been well studied. To help ﬁll this information gap, we estimate the cross-site standard deviation of ITT effects for a broad range of education and workforce development interventions using data from 16 large multisite randomized controlled trials.

		"abstract": "A valuable extension of the single-rating regression discontinuity design (RDD) is a multiple-rating RDD (MRRDD). To date, four main methods have been used to estimate average treatment effects at the multiple treatment frontiers of an MRRDD: the “surface” method, the “frontier” method, the “binding-score” method, and the “fuzzy instrumental variables” method. This article uses a series of simulations to evaluate the relative performance of each of these four methods under a variety of different data-generating models. Focusing on a two-rating RDD (2RRDD), we compare the methods in terms of their bias, precision, and mean squared error when implemented as they most likely would be in practice—using optimal bandwidth selection. We also apply the lessons learned from the simulations to a real-world example that uses data from a study of an English learner reclassiﬁcation policy. Overall, this article makes valuable contributions to the literature on MRRDDs in that it makes concrete recommendations for choosing among MRRDD estimation methods, for implementing any chosen method using local linear regression, and for providing accurate statistical inferences.",

This article extends previous results on optimal allocation to four-level cluster randomized designs and randomized block designs.

		"abstract": "In an effort to identify instructional methods that might improve mathematics learning at the grade 4 level when used in a variety of educational settings under typical conditions, the REL Mid-Atlantic research team looked for promising, replicable practices that were being used broadly by teachers in U.S. schools, for which research showed promising results but had not been conducted using methodologies that can establish causal relationships. CompassLearning's Odyssey[R] Math product met all of these criteria. Odyssey Math is a computer-based math curriculum developed by CompassLearning, Inc., to improve math learning for K-12 students. The software consists of a web-accessed series of learning activities, assessments, and math tools. These components constitute the basic framework of the software. CompassLearning professional development trainers presented the learning activities, math tools, and assessments as available options to intervention teachers during the summer professional development session. This study was the first randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of Odyssey Math on student achievement. The study had the statistical power needed to detect a 0.20 effect size and was well designed in that comparable groups were created at baseline and maintained through posttesting. Implementation during the school year was documented and shown to be consistent with typical implementation of the Odyssey Math software. The results from the multilevel model with pretest covariates also indicate that Odyssey Math did not yield a statistically significant impact on end-of-year student achievement. This study generated a statistically unbiased estimate of the effect of Odyssey Math on student achievement when implemented in typical school settings with typical teacher and student use. However, the findings apply only to participating schools, teachers, and students because the study used a volunteer sample.

		"abstract": "The purpose of this three-essay dissertation is to provide practical guidance to evaluators planning cluster-randomized trials (CRTs) of science achievement. In an educational setting, interventions are often administered at the cluster level, while outcomes are typically measured at the student level through standardized achievement testing. When evaluating an intervention, a CRT is appropriate because it allows for treatment to be modeled at a different level than the unit of analysis, and properly accounts for the violation of independence that occurs due to nesting. Accurately designing a CRT involves estimating variance parameters (i.e., intraclass correlations [ICCs] and percent of variance explained [R2] values). Prior efforts to improve the design of CRTs in education have primarily been limited to mathematics and reading disciplines, and the applicability of their findings to studies of science achievement is unknown.\n\nI use three essays to present decision scenarios an evaluator faces when designing a CRT. In the first essay, the evaluator has limited information to inform the selection of ICCs for a three-level CRT. I use surface plots of relative efficiency to explore the robustness of an optimal design to misspecification of the ICCs. Findings suggest that three-level CRTs are quite robust to misspecification of either or both ICCs. In the second essay, I resolve the challenge of limited information by using five years of achievement data from Texas to estimate ICCs for two- and three-level CRTs. I then analyze the decision of which covariate to include by estimating and evaluating R2 values for demographic and pretest covariates. Findings suggest ICCs are larger in science than in mathematics and reading, and when a one-year lagged student-level science pretest is unavailable, a one-year lagged school-level science pretest is preferred. In the final essay, I recognize that a multi-site CRT (MSCRT) design is often more appropriate than a CRT, and the evaluator must once again select appropriate variance design parameter values. Using the Texas data, I empirically estimate a distribution of within-district ICCs, and show the number of districts in the MSCRT can impact the average within-district ICC value.",

Several methods have been developed to handle the design and analytical issues for group randomized trial including the intraclass correlation coefficient. The widely used methods for the sample size calculation for the group randomized trial assume equal sizes across groups. In practice this assumption often fails and group randomized trial studies suffer from considerably lower statistical power than as planned. A few studies have developed sample size calculation methods for unequal group sizes, but most of them are limited to continuous outcomes. In this study, we develop a method for sample size calculation for group randomized trial studies with unequal group sizes based on Monte Carlo simulation in the mixed effect model framework. This approach incorporates the variation of group sizes and can be applied to group randomized trials with different types of outcomes. Further, it is easy to implement and can be applied to most commonly used group randomized trial designs such as pre-and-post cross-sectional and cohort study designs. We demonstrate the application of the proposed approach to two-arm group randomized trial studies with continuous and binary outcomes through simulations and analysis of a real group randomized trial dataset.",

Conducting a power analysis ensures that enough groups are sampled for testing hypotheses. The power analysis method and inputs must be informed by the hypotheses, effects to be tested, and the data analysis plans. The authors present a heuristic that can be combined with existing power analysis guidelines to select the appropriate power analysis method for a CRT given a well-defined research hypothesis. Using existing data, the authors demonstrate the heuristic in the context of a whole-school intervention program. The results indicate that the minimum number of schools needed to test the effect of the program can vary due to differences in hypotheses, making the heuristic an important research planning tool.",

		"abstract": "Background: The use of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) is increasing, along with the variety in their design and analysis. The simplest approach for their sample size calculation is to calculate the sample size assuming individual randomization and inﬂate this by a design effect to account for randomization by cluster. The assumptions of a simple design effect may not always be met; alternative or more complicated approaches are required.\nMethods: We summarise a wide range of sample size methods available for cluster randomized trials. For those familiar with sample size calculations for individually randomized trials but with less experience in the clustered case, this manuscript provides formulae for a wide range of scenarios with associated explanation and recommendations. For those with more experience, comprehensive summaries are provided that allow quick identiﬁcation of methods for a given design, outcome and analysis method.\nResults: We present ﬁrst those methods applicable to the simplest two-arm, parallel group, completely randomized design followed by methods that incorporate deviations from this design such as: variability in cluster sizes; attrition; non-compliance; or the inclusion of baseline covariates or repeated measures. The paper concludes with methods for alternative designs.\nConclusions: There is a large amount of methodology available for sample size calculations in CRTs. This paper gives the most comprehensive description of published methodology for sample size calculation and provides an important resource for those designing these trials.",

We discuss some contemporary forms of structural equation models (SEMs) based on the inclusion of latent variables. The speciﬁc goals of this review are to clarify basic SEM deﬁnitions, consider relations to classical models, focus on testable features of the new models, and provide recent references to more complete presentations. A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We ﬁrst outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider deﬁnitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, the number of studies using a cluster-randomized design has grown dramatically. In addition, the clusterrandomized crossover design has been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of clusterrandomized studies in certain situations. While the cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power. We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R, freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.",

Although the results of small scale randomized experiments and large-scale econometric studies point to positive effects of small classes, some scholar have seen the evidence as ambiguous. This paper reports analyses of a 4-year, large-scale randomized experiment on the effects of class size, project STAR in Tennessee. Although implementation was not perfect, these analyses suggest that shortcomings in implementation probably led to underestimates of the effects of class size. The analyses reported here suggest class size effects that are large enough to be important for educational policy and that are quite consistent across schools. Thus, small classes appear to benefit all kinds of students in all kinds of schools.",

		"abstract": "Field experiments with nested structures are becoming increasingly common, especially designs that assign randomly entire clusters such as schools to a treatment and a control group. In such large-scale cluster randomized studies the challenge is to obtain sufficient power of the test of the treatment effect. The objective is to maximize power without adding many clusters that make the study much more expensive. In this article I discuss how power estimates of tests of treatment effects in balanced cluster randomized designs are affected by covariates at different levels. I use third-grade data from Project STAR, a field experiment about class size, to demonstrate how covariates that explain a considerable proportion of variance in outcomes increase power significantly. When lower level covariates are group-mean centered and clustering effects are larger, top-level covariates increase power more than lower level covariates. In contrast, when clustering effects are smaller and lower level covariates are grand-mean centered or uncentered, lower level covariates increase power more than top-level covariates.",

		"abstract": "Students in some countries do far better on international achievement tests than students in other countries. Is this all due to differences in what students bring with them to school--socioeconomic background, cultural factors, and the like? Or do school systems make a difference? This essay argues that differences in features of countries' school systems, and in particular their institutional structures, account for a substantial part of the cross-country variation in student achievement. It first documents the size and cross-test consistency of international differences in student achievement. Next, it uses the framework of an education production function to provide descriptive analysis of the extent to which different factors of the school system, as well as factors beyond the school system, account for cross-country achievement differences. Finally, it covers research that goes beyond descriptive associations by addressing leading concerns of bias in cross-country analysis. The available evidence suggests that differences in expenditures and class size play a limited role in explaining cross-country achievement differences, but that differences in teacher quality and instruction time do matter. This suggests that what matters is not so much the amount of inputs that school systems are endowed with, but rather how they use them. Correspondingly, international differences in institutional structures of school systems such as external exams, school autonomy, private competition, and tracking have been found to be important sources of international differences in student achievement.",

Given the multilevel nature of these studies, the power analyses for these studies are more complex than in a simple individually randomized trial. Tools are now available to help researchers conduct power analyses for cluster randomized trials. A key challenge facing researchers in using the tools is that different tools use different language, notation, and design parameters. This makes it difﬁcult for researchers to communicate about the steps for a power analysis or to evaluate the appropriateness of a power analysis. This article provides explicit connections between the language, notation, and design parameters of two widely used approaches and tools for conducting power analyses, Optimal Design Plus and CRT Power. The formulas for translating design parameters between the two programs are provided and the comparability of the two programs is illustrated.",

		"abstract": "In multilevel modeling (MLM), group-level (L2) characteristics are often measured by aggregating individual-level (L1) characteristics within each group so as to assess contextual effects (e.g., group-average effects of socioeconomic status, achievement, climate). Most previous applications have used a multilevel manifest covariate (MMC) approach, in which the observed (manifest) group mean is assumed to be perfectly reliable. This article demonstrates mathematically and with simulation results that this MMC approach can result in substantially biased estimates of contextual effects and can substantially underestimate the associated standard errors, depending on the number of L1 individuals per group, the number of groups, the intraclass correlation, the sampling ratio (the percentage of cases within each group sampled), and the nature of the data. To address this pervasive problem, the authors introduce a new multilevel latent covariate (MLC) approach that corrects for unreliability at L2 and results in unbiased estimates of L2 constructs under appropriate conditions. However, under some circumstances when the sampling ratio approaches 100%, the MMC approach provides more accurate estimates. Based on 3 simulations and 2 real-data applications, the authors evaluate the MMC and MLC approaches and suggest when researchers should most appropriately use one, the other, or a combination of both approaches.",

Many of the common missing data practices in prevention research are still, unfortunately, ill-advised (e.g., use of listwise and pairwise deletion, insufficient use of auxiliary variables). Our goal is to promote better practice in the handling of missing data. We review the current state of missing data methodology and recent missing data reporting in prevention research. We describe antiquated, ad hoc missing data treatments and discuss their limitations. We discuss two modern, principled missing data treatments: multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood, and we offer practical tips on how to best employ these methods in prevention research. The principled missing data treatments that we discuss are couched in terms of how they improve causal and statistical inference in the prevention sciences. Our recommendations are firmly grounded in missing data theory and well-validated statistical principles for handling the missing data issues that are ubiquitous in biosocial and prevention research. We augment our broad survey of missing data analysis with references to more exhaustive resources.",

The other is the size of gaps in mean achievement among schools\n(adjusted for student characteristics).

		"abstract": "Objectives:Group-randomized designs are well suited for studies of professional development because they can accommodate programs that are delivered to intact groups (e.g., schools), the collaborative nature of professional development, and extant teacher/school assignments. Though group designs may be theoretically favorable, prior evidence has suggested that they may be challenging to conduct in professional development studies because well-powered designs will typically require large sample sizes or expect large effect sizes. Using teacher knowledge outcomes in mathematics, we investigated when and the extent to which there is evidence that covariance adjustment on a pretest, teacher certification, or demographic covariates can reduce the sample size necessary to achieve reasonable power.Method:Our analyses drew on multilevel models and outcomes in five different content areas for over 4,000 teachers and 2,000 schools. Using these estimates, we assessed the minimum detectable effect sizes for several school-randomized designs with and without covariance adjustment.Results:The analyses suggested that teachers? knowledge is substantially clustered within schools in each of the five content areas and that covariance adjustment for a pretest or, to a lesser extent, teacher certification, has the potential to transform designs that are unreasonably large for professional development studies into viable studies.",

		"abstract": "Introduction:When cluster randomized trials are used to evaluate school-based nutritional interventions such as school lunch programs, design-stage estimates of the required sample size must take into account the correlation in outcomes among individuals within each cluster (e.g., classrooms, schools, or districts). Estimates of the necessary parameters have been carefully developed for educational interventions, but for nutritional interventions the literature is thin.Methods:Using data from two large multi-school, multi-district impact evaluations conducted in the United States, this article calculates estimates of the design parameters required for sizing school-based nutritional studies. The large size of the trials (252 and 1,327 schools) yields precise estimates of the parameters of interest. Variance components are estimated by fitting random-intercept multilevel models in Stata.Results:School-level intraclass correlations are similar to those typically found for educational outcomes. In particular, school-level estimates range from less than .01 to .26 across the two studies, and district-level estimates ranged from less than .01 to .19. This suggests that cluster randomized trials of nutritional interventions may require samples with numbers of schools similar to the education studies to detect similar effect sizes.",

This approach is applied to the assessment of effect size measures for educational interventions designed to improve student academic achievement. Three types of empirical benchmarks are illustrated: (a) normative expectations for growth over time in student achievement, (b) policyrelevant gaps in student achievement by demographic group or school performance, and (c) effect size results from past research for similar interventions and target populations.

Furthermore, for both procedures, a larger number of combined cases resulted in higher statistical power, with many realistic conditions reaching statistical power of 80% or higher.

		"abstract": "This paper examines how pretest measures of a study outcome reduce selection bias in observational studies in education. The theoretical rationale for privileging pretests in bias control is that they are often highly correlated with the outcome, and in many contexts, they are also highly correlated with the selection process. To examine the pretest’s role in bias reduction, we use the data from two within study comparisons and an especially strong quasi-experiment, each with an educational intervention that seeks to improve achievement. In each study, the pretest measures are consistently highly correlated with post-intervention measures of themselves, but the studies vary the correlation between the pretest and the process of selection into treatment. Across the three datasets with two outcomes each, there are three cases where this correlation is low and three where it is high. A single wave of pretest always reduces bias across the six instances examined, and it eliminates bias in three of them. Adding a second pretest wave eliminates bias in two more instances. However, the pattern of bias elimination does not follow the predicted pattern—that more bias reduction ensues as a function of how highly the pretest is correlated with selection. The findings show that bias is more complexly related to the pretest’s correlation with selection than we hypothesized, and we seek to explain why.",

		"abstract": "Objective. Sample size and statistical power calculation should consider clustering effects when schools are the unit of randomization in intervention studies. The objective of the current study was to investigate how student outcomes are clustered within schools in an obesity prevention trial. Method. Baseline data from the Food, Health & Choices project were used. Participants were 9- to 13-year-old students enrolled in 20 New York City public schools (n = 1,387). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on measures of height and weight, and body fat percentage was measured with a Tanita® body composition analyzer (Model SC-331s). Energy balance–related behaviors were self-reported with a frequency questionnaire. To examine the cluster effects, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated as school variance over total variance for outcome variables. School-level covariates, percentage students eligible for free and reduced-price lunch, percentage Black or Hispanic, and English language learners were added in the model to examine ICC changes. Results. The ICCs for obesity indicators are: .026 for BMI-percentile, .031 for BMI z-score, .035 for percentage of overweight students, .037 for body fat percentage, and .041 for absolute BMI. The ICC range for the six energy balance–related behaviors are .008 to .044 for fruit and vegetables, .013 to .055 for physical activity, .031 to .052 for recreational screen time, .013 to .091 for sweetened beverages, .033 to .121 for processed packaged snacks, and .020 to .083 for fast food. When school-level covariates were included in the model, ICC changes varied from −95% to 85%. Conclusions. This is the first study reporting ICCs for obesity-related anthropometric and behavioral outcomes among New York City public schools. The results of the study may aid sample size estimation for future school-based cluster randomized controlled trials in similar urban setting and population. Additionally, identifying school-level covariates that can reduce cluster effects is important when analyzing data.",

When applying MI to multilevel data, it is important that the imputation model takes the multilevel structure into account. In the present paper, based on theoretical arguments and computer simulations, we provide guidance using MI in the context of several classes of multilevel models, including models with random intercepts, random slopes, cross-level interactions (CLIs), and missing data in categorical and group-level variables. Our findings suggest that, oftentimes, several approaches to MI provide an effective treatment of missing data in multilevel research. Yet we also note that the current implementations of MI still have room for improvement when handling missing data in explanatory variables in models with random slopes and CLIs.

In turn, researchers have also begun to push longitudinal methods by asking more complex developmental questions. One such question involves the relationships between two developmental processes. In this situation, choosing a longitudinal method is not obvious and should depend on specific hypotheses and research questions. This article outlines three common bivariate longitudinal models, including the bivariate latent growth curve model, the latent growth curve with a time-varying covariate, and the bivariate dual change score growth model, and illustrates their use by modeling how the development of depression is related to the development of achievement. Each longitudinal model is fitted to repeated measurements of children's depression and achievement from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data set in order to examine differing developmental relationships, and show how the developmental questions are answered by each longitudinal technique. The results from the longitudinal models appear to be somewhat at odds with one another regarding the developmental relationships between achievement and depression, but the conclusions are actually correct solutions to different developmental questions. These results highlight the need for researchers to match their research questions with model selection.",

		"abstract": "Background:This article offers important statistics to evaluators planning future evaluations in southeast Africa. There are little to no published statistics describing the variance of southeast African agricultural and household indicators.Objective:We seek to publish the standard deviations, intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs), and R2s from outcomes and covariates used in a 2014 quasi-experimental evaluation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation?s Mozambique Farmer Income Support Project (FISP) and thus guide researchers in their calculation of design effects relevant to future evaluations in the region.Method:We summarize data from a roughly 168-item farmer survey conducted in 1,227 households during June?July 2014 in coconut-farming regions of the Zambezia province in Mozambique. We report descriptive statistics, estimates of ICC, and R2s obtained from linear regression models with cluster random effects. We consider three different cluster definitions.Results:We report ICCs for a range of different specifications. For the FISP evaluation, the average design effect for education outcomes is 1.16. Average design effects for wealth measures based on consumption are 1.23. For agricultural-related outcomes, 1.05 is the average design effects for income measures, 1.47 for knowledge, and 1.64 for sales of specific crops.Conclusion:We offer a detailed picture of the variance structure of agricultural and other outcomes in Mozambique. Our results indicate that the design effect associated with these outcomes is less than the rule-of-thumb design effect (2.0) used in nutrition studies which are commonly cited in the studies of this region.",

		"abstract": "Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted—the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research.",

		"abstract": "Although missing data methods have advanced in recent years, methodologists have devoted less attention to multilevel data structures where observations at level-1 are nested within higher-order organizational units at level-2 (e.g., individuals within neighborhoods; repeated measures nested within individuals; students nested within classrooms). Joint modeling and chained equations imputation are the principal imputation frameworks for single-level data, and both have multilevel counterparts. These approaches differ algorithmically and in their functionality; both are appropriate for simple random intercept analyses with normally distributed data, but they differ beyond that. The purpose of this paper is to describe multilevel imputation strategies and evaluate their performance in a variety of common analysis models. Using multiple imputation theory and computer simulations, we derive 4 major conclusions: (a) joint modeling and chained equations imputation are appropriate for random intercept analyses; (b) the joint model is superior for analyses that posit different within- and between-cluster associations (e.g., a multilevel regression model that includes a level-1 predictor and its cluster means, a multilevel structural equation model with different path values at level-1 and level-2); (c) chained equations imputation provides a dramatic improvement over joint modeling in random slope analyses; and (d) a latent variable formulation for categorical variables is quite effective. We use a real data analysis to demonstrate multilevel imputation, and we suggest a number of avenues for future research.",

But cluster-level designs face some unique or exacerbated challenges. The article identifies them and offers some principles about them. One emphasizes how statistical power and sample size estimation depend on intraclass correlations, particularly after conditioning on the use of cluster-level covariates. Another stresses assigning experimental units at the lowest level of aggregation possible, provided this does not subtly change the research question. A third emphasizes the utility of minimizing and measuring interunit communication, though neither is easy to achieve. A fourth advises against experiments that are totally black box and so leave program implementation and process unstudied, though such study often makes the research process more salient. The last principle involves the utility of describing treatment heterogeneity and estimating its consequences, though causal conclusions about the heterogeneity will be less well warranted compared to conclusions about the intended treatment, every experiment's major focus.",

This typically leads to an overstatement of the precision of results and anticonservative conclusions about precision and statistical significance of treatment effects. This article gives a simple correction to the t statistic that would be computed if clustering were (incorrectly) ignored. The correction is a multiplicative factor depending on the total sample size, the cluster size, and the intraclass correlation ρ. The corrected t statistic has Student’s t distribution with reduced degrees of freedom. The corrected statistic reduces to the t statistic computed by ignoring clustering when ρ = 0. It reduces to the t statistic computed using cluster means when ρ = 1. If 0 < ρ < 1, it lies between these two, and the degrees of freedom are in between those corresponding to these two extremes.",

		"abstract": "Objectives: To clarify and illustrate sample size calculations for the cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) and to present a simple approach for comparing the efﬁciencies of competing designs within a uniﬁed framework. Study Design and Setting: We summarize design effects for the SW-CRT, the parallel cluster randomized trial (CRT), and the parallel cluster randomized trial with before and after observations (CRT-BA), assuming cross-sectional samples are selected over time. We present new formulas that enable trialists to determine the required cluster size for a given number of clusters. We illustrate by example how to implement the presented design effects and give practical guidance on the design of stepped wedge studies.\nResults: For a ﬁxed total cluster size, the choice of study design that provides the greatest power depends on the intracluster correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) and the cluster size. When the ICC is small, the CRT tends to be more efﬁcient; when the ICC is large, the SW-CRT tends to be more efﬁcient and can serve as an alternative design when the CRT is an infeasible design.\nConclusion: Our uniﬁed approach allows trialists to easily compare the efﬁciencies of three competing designs to inform the decision about the most efﬁcient design in a given scenario.

		"abstract": "The cluster randomised trial (CRT) is commonly used in healthcare research. It is the gold-standard study design for evaluating healthcare policy interventions. A key characteristic of this design is that as more participants are included, in a fixed number of clusters, the increase in achievable power will level off. CRTs with cluster sizes that exceed the point of levelling-off will have excessive numbers of participants, even if they do not achieve nominal levels of power. Excessively large cluster sizes may have ethical implications due to exposing trial participants unnecessarily to the burdens of both participating in the trial and the potential risks of harm associated with the intervention. We explore these issues through the use of two case studies. Where data are routinely collected, available at minimum cost and the intervention poses low risk, the ethical implications of excessively large cluster sizes are likely to be low (case study 1). However, to maximise the social benefit of the study, identification of excessive cluster sizes can allow for prespecified and fully powered secondary analyses. In the second case study, while there is no burden through trial participation (because the outcome data are routinely collected and non-identifiable), the intervention might be considered to pose some indirect risk to patients and risks to the healthcare workers. In this case study it is therefore important that the inclusion of excessively large cluster sizes is justifiable on other grounds (perhaps to show sustainability). In any randomised controlled trial, including evaluations of health policy interventions, it is important to minimise the burdens and risks to participants. Funders, researchers and research ethics committees should be aware of the ethical issues of excessively large cluster sizes in cluster trials.",

Despite its large spread, there are still some questions regarding the use of plausible values and how such use affects statistical analyses. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the role of plausible values in large-scale assessment surveys when multilevel modeling is used. Different user strategies concerning plausible values for multilevel models as well as means and variances are examined. The results show that some commonly used user strategies give incorrect results while others give reasonable estimates but incorrect standard errors.

		"abstract": "Background: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is widely used in biomedical research to assess the reproducibility of measurements between raters, labs, technicians, or devices. For example, in an inter-rater reliability study, a high ICC value means that noise variability (between-raters and within-raters) is small relative to variability from patient to patient. A confidence interval or Bayesian credible interval for the ICC is a commonly reported summary. Such intervals can be constructed employing either frequentist or Bayesian methodologies.\nMethods: This study examines the performance of three different methods for constructing an interval in a two-way, crossed, random effects model without interaction: the Generalized Confidence Interval method (GCI), the Modified Large Sample method (MLS), and a Bayesian method based on a noninformative prior distribution (NIB). Guidance is provided on interval construction method selection based on study design, sample size, and normality of the data. We compare the coverage probabilities and widths of the different interval methods.\nResults: We show that, for the two-way, crossed, random effects model without interaction, care is needed in interval method selection because the interval estimates do not always have properties that the user expects. While different methods generally perform well when there are a large number of levels of each factor, large differences between the methods emerge when the number of one or more factors is limited. In addition, all methods are shown to lack robustness to certain hard-to-detect violations of normality when the sample size is limited.\nConclusions: Decision rules and software programs for interval construction are provided for practical implementation in the two-way, crossed, random effects model without interaction. All interval methods perform similarly when the data are normal and there are sufficient numbers of levels of each factor. The MLS and GCI methods outperform the NIB when one of the factors has a limited number of levels and the data are normally distributed or nearly normally distributed. None of the methods work well if the number of levels of a factor are limited and data are markedly non-normal. The software programs are implemented in the popular R language.",

		"abstract": "Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) have been widely used in ﬁeld experiments treating a cluster of individuals as the unit of randomization. This study focused particularly on situations where CRTs are accompanied by a common complication, namely, treatment noncompliance or, more generally, intervention nonadherence. In CRTs, compliance may be related not only to individual characteristics but also to the environment of clusters individuals belong to. Therefore, analyses ignoring the connection between compliance and clustering may not provide valid results. Although randomized ﬁeld experiments often suffer from both noncompliance and clustering of the data, these features have been studied as separate rather than concurrent problems. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, this study demonstrated how clustering and noncompliance may affect statistical inferences and how these two complications can be accounted for simultaneously. In particular, the effect of the intervention on individuals who not only were assigned to active intervention but also abided by this intervention assignment (complier average causal effect) was the focus. For estimation of intervention effects considering noncompliance and data clustering, an ML-EM estimation method was employed.",

This results in a two-way nested design. The usual issue of sample size and power now arises for various clinically relevant contrast hypotheses. Assuming a fixed total sample size at each level (number of clusters or centers, number of patients), we derive the optimal proportion of the total sample to be allocated to each treatment arm. We consider treatment assignment first at the highest level (cluster randomized trial) and then at the lowest level (multicenter trial). We derive the optimal allocation ratio for various sets of clinically relevant hypotheses. We then evaluate the efficiency of each allocation and show that the popular balanced design is optimal or highly efficient for a range of research questions except for contrasting one treatment arm with all other treatment arms. We finally present simple equations for the total sample size needed to test each effect of interest in a balanced design, as a function of effect size, power and type I error  . All results are illustrated on a cluster-randomized trial on smoking prevention in primary schools and on a multicenter trial on lifestyle improvement in general practices.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, research in the area of intervention development has been shifting from the traditional fixed-intervention approach to adaptive interventions, which allow greater individualization and adaptation of intervention options (i.e., intervention type and/or dosage) over time. Adaptive interventions are operationalized via a sequence of decision rules that specify how intervention options should be adapted to an individual’s characteristics and changing needs, with the general aim to optimize the long-term effectiveness of the intervention. Here, we review adaptive interventions, discussing the potential contribution of this concept to research in the behavioral and social sciences. We then propose the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), an experimental design useful for addressing research questions that inform the construction of high-quality adaptive interventions. To clarify the SMART approach and its advantages, we compare SMART with other experimental approaches. We also provide methods for analyzing data from SMART to address primary research questions that inform the construction of a high-quality adaptive intervention.",

Experiments within this framework can be particularly powerful when they draw on a wide range of disciplines including child development, psychology, and behavioural economics. Insights from these areas can help identify underlying mechanisms of the education production function and inform the design of interventions in ways that increase (cost-) effectiveness. Additionally, I argue that there should be a rich array of experiments in education, ranging from lab-like basic research to policy-level efficacy trials. Finally, I discuss the policy-maker’s role in integrating experimentation into policy decision-making, including how to address concerns commonly raised with experimentation in education.",

To this end, we drew on 2 structural conceptions of intelligence: (a) the extended Gf-Gc model to study broad cognitive abilities and (b) the 3-stratum model to decompose cognitive change into processes that are shared by all broad abilities (attributable to general cognitive ability g) and processes specific to a certain ability (independent of g). Data were obtained for 344 persons (56.4% female). The results showed that people differ more greatly over time with respect to all broad abilities except for fluid reasoning, whereas the rank ordering of persons on all broad abilities remains remarkably stable. These combined results yielded substantial gap-widening effects from age 12 to age 52 years that were mainly accounted for by a substantial increase in g variance in combination with a high differential stability of g. Moreover, the increase in g variance reflects an increase in covariance among different broad abilities, which indicates that the different constructs relate more closely to each other at age 52 compared to age 12 (i.e., age dedifferentiation). Two theoretical explanations of this change in the structure of intelligence are discussed (common cause hypothesis and investment theory).",

		"abstract": "Very often researchers plan a balanced design for cluster randomization clinical trials in conducting medical research, but unavoidable circumstances lead to unbalanced data. By adopting three or more levels of nested designs, they usually ignore the higher level of nesting and consider only two levels, this situation leads to underestimation of variance at higher levels. While calculating the sample size for three-level nested designs, in order to achieve desired power, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) at individual level as well as higher levels need to be considered and must be provided along with respective standard errors. In the present paper, the standard errors of analysis of variance (ANOVA) estimates of ICCs for three-level unbalanced nested design are derived. To conquer the strong appeal of distributional assumptions, balanced design, equality of variances between clusters and large sample, general expressions for standard errors of ICCs which can be deployed in unbalanced cluster randomization trials are postulated. The expressions are evaluated on real data as well as highly unbalanced simulated data.",

We extracted 147,328 correlations and developed a hierarchical taxonomy of variables reported in Journal of Applied Psychology and Personnel Psychology from 1980 to 2010 to produce empirical effect size benchmarks at the omnibus level, for 20 common research domains, and for an even finer grained level of generality. Results indicate that the usual interpretation and classification of effect sizes as small, medium, and large bear almost no resemblance to findings in the field, because distributions of effect sizes exhibit tertile partitions at values approximately one-half to one-third those intuited by Cohen (1988). Our results offer information that can be used for research planning and design purposes, such as producing better informed non-nil hypotheses and estimating statistical power and planning sample size accordingly. We also offer information useful for understanding the relative importance of the effect sizes found in a particular study in relationship to others and which research domains have advanced more or less, given that larger effect sizes indicate a better understanding of a phenomenon. Also, our study offers information about research domains for which the investigation of moderating effects may be more fruitful and provide information that is likely to facilitate the implementation of Bayesian analysis. Finally, our study offers information that practitioners can use to evaluate the relative effectiveness of various types of interventions.",

		"abstract": "Data in educational research commonly have a multilevel structure – students are nested within classes and schools. Nested structures are particularly salient when students are asked to rate aspects of the school context (e.g., teachers, school climate) on several dimensions, and these student ratings are then used for further analyses of both the individual level and the aggregated class level. Confirmatory multilevel factor analysis is particularly suited to analyzing data of this kind, but this method is not yet sufficiently well established. In this paper, we demonstrate the principles and application of multilevel factor analysis using a dataset from homework research (1712 students in 98 classes). As expected, the three factors under investigation (homework quality, teachers’ homework control, and effective use of learning time in French lessons) were empirically distinguishable at both the student and the class level. Moreover, homework quality and effective use of learning time proved to have positive effects on self reported homework effort at both the student and the class level.",

The modeling of contextual effects is covered. One particularity in longitudinal data is the fact that persons (level-2) may be regarded as the context of the time-varying observations on level-1.

We further investigate the role multicollinearity plays at each level for estimation of coefﬁcient parameters in terms of shrinkage. Based on these analyses, we recommend a top-down method for assessing multicollinearity in HLMs that ﬁrst examines the contextual predictors (Level-2 in a two-level model) and then the individual predictors (Level-1) and uses the results for data collection, research problem redeﬁnition, model re-speciﬁcation, variable selection and estimation of a ﬁnal model.",

In this paper we discuss the theoretical position of “cross-pressures” in the structural-individualist paradigm and present methods for modeling cross-pressures in multilevel regression models. We argue that cross pressures form a specific class of context effects, that is macro-micro links, and sketch a reconstruction as part of the problem of defining the social situation in the Model of Frame Selection. The theoretical model implies that empirical applications of the concept would ideally use multiplicative terms for the specification of cross-level interactions in multilevel models. Modeling random slopes and context fixed-effects the interaction can be identified empirically. As an example we analyze the relation between postmaterialism and environmental concern, moderated by national wealth using WVS data. Our results indicate that postmaterialism and environmental concern form an integrated value cluster in wealthy societies, but are separate constructs in poorer societies.",

With increasing model complexity, estimation becomes computationally demanding, and small sample sizes pose further challenges on estimation methods relying on asymptotic theory. Recent developments of Bayesian estimation techniques may help to overcome the shortcomings of classical estimation techniques. The use of potentially inaccurate prior information may, however, have detrimental effects, especially in small samples. The present Monte Carlo simulation study compares the statistical performance of classical estimation techniques with Bayesian estimation using different prior specifications for a two-level SEM with either continuous or ordinal indicators. Using two software programs (Mplus and Stan), differential effects of between- and within-level sample sizes on estimation accuracy were investigated. Moreover, it was tested to which extent inaccurate priors may have detrimental effects on parameter estimates in categorical indicator models. For continuous indicators, Bayesian estimation did not show performance advantages over ML. For categorical indicators, Bayesian estimation outperformed WLSMV solely in case of strongly informative accurate priors. Weakly informative inaccurate priors did not deteriorate performance of the Bayesian approach, while strong informative inaccurate priors led to severely biased estimates even with large sample sizes. With diffuse priors, Stan yielded better results than Mplus in terms of parameter estimates.",

		"abstract": "1. The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models.\n2. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, how-ever, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest.\n3. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation).\n4. Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems.\n5. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.",

Researchers often collect nested, hierarchical data—such as multiple assessments per person—but they typically ignore the nested data structure by averaging across a level of data. Multilevel modeling, also known as hierarchical linear modeling and random coefficient modeling, enables researchers to test old hypotheses more powerfully and to ask new research questions. After describing the logic of multilevel analysis, the article illustrates three practical uses of multilevel modeling: (1) estimating within-person relationships, (2) examining between-person differences in within-person processes, and (3) comparing people’s judgments to a criterion. The breadth, flexibility, and power of multilevel modeling make it a useful analytic tool for the multilevel data that researchers have been collecting all along.",

		"abstract": "When planning to conduct a study, not only is it important to select a sample size that will ensure adequate statistical power, often it is important to select a sample size that results in accurate effect size estimates. In cluster-randomized designs (CRD), such planning presents special challenges. In CRD studies, instead of assigning individual objects to treatment conditions, objects are grouped in clusters, and these clusters are then assigned to different treatment conditions. Sample size in CRD studies is a function of 2 components: the number of clusters and the cluster size. Planning to conduct a CRD study is difficult because 2 distinct sample size combinations might be associated with similar costs but can result in dramatically different levels of statistical power and accuracy in effect size estimation. Thus, we present a method that assists researchers in finding the least expensive sample size combination that still results in adequate accuracy in effect size estimation. Alternatively, if researchers have a fixed budget, they can select the sample size combination that results in the most precise estimate of effect size. A free computer program that automates these procedures is available.",

		"abstract": "In recent years, there has been increased attention to the issue of conflict of interest within prevention research. The aims of this paper are to discuss these developments and to relate them to discussions of conflict of interest in the broader scientific literature. Although there has been concern expressed about the extent to which conflicts of interest can be defined and measured, empirical research suggests that financial conflicts can be easily identified and assessed in meta-analyses focused on their effects on research quality. Research evidence also shows that conflict of interest is associated with use of flexible data analysis practices and the reporting of chance positive findings, both within prevention research and related disciplines such as public health and psychology. However, the overwhelming majority of published studies report positive results, and there are a number of other influences within academia (such as pressure to publish) that account for this and for the use of flexible data analysis practices. Accordingly, introducing measures to improve research quality in general, rather than just focusing on problems specific to research in which there is a clearly identifiable conflict of interest, may prove more effective and less controversial. Most such efforts focus on introducing greater transparency into research design, practice, and reporting. These both curtail employment of flexible data analysis practices and make their use transparent to investigators seeking to assess their effects on research quality. Also, requiring detailed disclosures of conflicts be reported by all investigators (not just senior authors) would improve current disclosure practices.",

		"abstract": "Background: Cluster-randomized trials (CRT) are needed to compare interventions that are allocated to entire groups of subjects, rather than to individuals. Publications about CRT have become steadily more common over the past decade. Readers of such publications should be able to categorize and interpret the findings of CRT correctly while considering the methodological requirements applicable to this type of study.\nMethods: This review is based on a selection of pertinent literature and on the authors’ expertise. CRT-specific methodological aspects of the planning, performance, and interpretation of studies are discussed.\nResults: Readers of publications on CRT should check whether due consideration has been given to correlations within and between the clusters during the planning of the study. These correlations enable the determination whether persons within a cluster resemble each other more closely, or respond more similarly to the study intervention, than persons drawn from different clusters. It should also be checked whether the randomization for the study has been carried out with such methods as stratification and covariate-adjusted randomization. CRT can be analyzed on either the individual or the cluster level. The rationale for the choice of a clusterrandomized design should be explained, and intracluster correlation coefficients (ICC) should be reported as an aid to the planning of future studies. Particular requirements are also described in an extended version of the CONSORT guidelines that has been developed specifically for CRT.\nConclusion: Readers of publications on CRT should be aware of the special requirements mentioned above with respect to the design, performance, and analysis of this type of study as opposed to individually randomized studies. If no special techniques are applied in the design, performance, and analysis of a CRT, or if the assumptions underlying each of these steps have not been properly checked, then the findings of the study may well be misleading.",

		"abstract": "Attrition occurs when study participants who were assigned to the treatment and control conditions do not provide outcome data and thus do not contribute to the estimation of the treatment effects. It is very common in experimental studies in education as illustrated, for instance, in a meta-analysis studying \"the effects of attrition on baseline comparability in randomized experiments in education\" (Valentine & McHugh, 2007) that found that 119 of 367 randomized education experiments reported student-level attrition. Shadish et al (1998) called attrition the Achilles' heel of randomized experiments. Attrition reduces statistical power by decreasing sample size. It compromises external validity when those who do not contribute data are unrepresentative of the original sample and thus degrade the representativeness of those who remain in the sample (Orr, 1999). The main purpose of this study is to elaborate a model of the relationships between attrition and effect estimates and to use that model to guide Monte Carlo simulations that examine the sources and magnitude of attrition bias under various assumptions for randomized experiments and cluster randomized experiments. This study modeled the sources of attrition bias under various assumptions for completely randomized controlled trials (RCT) and (to be provided by the time of the SREE meeting) cluster randomized controlled trials (CRT). The overall bias is associated with both the overall attrition rate and the differential attrition rate, and both the overall and differential correlations between y and z for the treatment and control groups. In addition, these results show that bias can be reduced by including baseline covariates in the impact estimate model if those covariates are correlated with both the latent propensity to respond and the outcome variable.

Without a detailed power analysis, reviewers may have difﬁcultly evaluating the accuracy of the power analysis and underpowered studies may inadvertently pass through the review process with a recommendation for funding. This study reveals that sample sizes are reported with high consistency; however, other important design parameters, including intraclass correlations, covariate-outcome correlations, and the percentage of variance explained by blocking are not reported with regularity. An analysis of reporting trends over time reveals that the reporting of intraclass correlations and covariate-outcome correlations dramatically increased over time.

		"abstract": "Researchers designing multisite and cluster randomized trials of educational interventions will usually conduct a power analysis in the planning stage of the study. To conduct the power analysis, researchers often use estimates of intracluster correlation coefficients and effect sizes derived from an analysis of survey data. When there is heterogeneity in treatment effects across the clusters in the study, these parameters will need to be adjusted to produce an accurate power analysis for a hierarchical trial design. The relevant adjustment factors are derived and presented in the current article. The adjustment factors depend upon the covariance between treatment effects and cluster-specific average values of the outcome variable, illustrating the need for better information about this parameter. The results in the article also facilitate understanding of the relative power of multisite and cluster randomized studies conducted on the same population by showing how the parameters necessary to compute power in the two types of designs are related. This is accomplished by relating parameters defined by linear mixed model specifications to parameters defined in terms of potential outcomes.",

We also compare OLS to alternative random effects estimators, such as generalized least squares (GLS). Our simulations assess efficiency across a variety of scenarios involving varying sample sizes and numbers of clusters. Our results confirm that conventional OLS SEs are severely biased downward and that, for all estimators, gains in efficiency come mainly from increasing the number of clusters, not increasing the number of individuals within clusters. We find relatively minor differences across alternative estimation approaches, but GLS seems to enjoy a slight edge in terms of the efficiency of its point estimates and the accuracy of its SEs. We illustrate the application of alternative estimation approaches using a clustered experiment in which Rock the Vote TV advertisements were used to encourage young voters in 85 cable TV markets to vote in the 2004 presidential election.",

These methods are demonstrated using data from the Teens Eating for Energy and Nutrition at School study. Mixed-model analyses of covariance proved to be the most powerful analysis in that data set.

		"abstract": "Knowing every child’s social-emotional development is important as it can support prevention and intervention approaches to meet the developmental needs and strengths of children. Here, we discuss the role of social-emotional assessment tools in planning, implementing, and evaluating preventative strategies to promote mental health in all children and adolescents. We, first, selectively review existing tools and identify current gaps in the measurement literature. Next, we introduce the Holistic Student Assessment (HSA), a tool that is based in our social-emotional developmental theory, The Clover Model, and designed to measure social-emotional development in children and adolescents. Using a sample of 5946 students (51% boys, M age = 13.16 years), we provide evidence for the psychometric validity of the self-report version of the HSA. First, we document the theoretically expected 7-dimension factor structure in a calibration sub-sample (n = 984) and cross-validate its structure in a validation sub-sample (n = 4962). Next, we show measurement invariance across development, i.e., late childhood (9- to 11-year-olds), early adolescence (12- to 14-year-olds), and middle adolescence (15- to 18-year-olds), and evidence for the HSA’s construct validity in each age group. The findings support the robustness of the factor structure and confirm its developmental sensitivity. Structural equation modeling validity analysis in a multiple-group framework indicates that the HSA is associated with mental health in expected directions across ages. Overall, these findings show the psychometric properties of the tool, and we discuss how social-emotional tools such as the HSA can guide future research and inform large-scale dissemination of preventive strategies.",

In particular, the work of the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking points to directions that have implications for capacity building and the institutionalization of economic evaluation, as well as mechanisms and resources that could make economic evaluation more feasible. Bipartisan legislation incorporates many of the recommendations of the Commission and reinforces efforts already underway at individual agencies as well as among interagency groups. Understanding the current context of evidence-based policymaking in the federal government can enable economic researchers to better influence the processes of capacity building, shape the designs of evaluations, and inform decision-making.

Mean effect size distributions were established by examining the findings from 74 metaanalyses of universal prevention and promotion programs that included more than 1100 controlled outcome studies involving over 490,000 school-age youth. The distributions of mean effect sizes from these meta-analyses indicated considerable variability across program targets and outcomes that differed substantially from Cohen’s (1988, Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences (2nd ed.)) widely used set of conventions for assessing if effects are small, medium, or large. These updated mean effect size distributions will provide researchers, practitioners, and funders with more appropriate evidence-based standards for judging the relative effects of universal prevention programs for youth. Limitations in current data and directions for future work are also discussed.",

We illustrate the use of these estimates to explore the absolute and relative sensitivity of multilevel designs in teacher professional development studies.

Many of these designs involve two levels of clustering or nesting (students within classes and classes within schools). Researchers would like to compute effect size indexes based on the standardized mean difference to compare the results of cluster-randomized studies with other studies and to combine information across studies in meta-analyses. This article addresses the problem of defining effect sizes in designs with two levels of clustering and computing estimates of those effect sizes and their standard errors from information that is likely to be reported in journal articles. Five effect sizes are defined corresponding to different standardizations. Estimators of each effect size index are also presented along with their sampling distributions (including standard errors).",

We conduct a simulation study to determine the effect various factors have on the estimation method. The factors we included in this study are scaling method, size of clusters, invariance of selection, informativeness of selection, intraclass correlation, and variability of standardized weights. The scaling method is an indicator of how the weights are normalized on each level. The invariance of the selection is an indicator of whether or not the same selection mechanism is applied across clusters. The informativeness of the selection is an indicator of how biased the selection is. We summarize our findings and recommend a multi-stage procedure based on the MPML method that can be used in practical applications.",

		"abstract": "Political scientists often analyze data in which the observational units are clustered into politically or socially meaningful groups with an interest in estimating the effects that group-level factors have on individual-level behavior. Even in the presence of low levels of intracluster correlation, it is well known among statisticians that ignoring the clustered nature of such data overstates the precision estimates for group-level effects. Although a number of methods that account for clustering are available, their precision estimates are poorly understood, making it difficult for researchers to choose among approaches. In this paper, we explicate and compare commonly used methods (clustered robust standard errors (SEs), random effects, hierarchical linear model, and aggregated ordinary least squares) of estimating the SEs for group-level effects. We demonstrate analytically and with the help of empirical examples that under ideal conditions there is no meaningful difference in the SEs generated by these methods. We conclude with advice on the ways in which analysts can increase the efficiency of clustered designs.",

The review covers four broad research areas of substantive and policy interest: ﬁrst, randomized controlled trials, with a focus on policy interventions in economic development, poverty reduction, and education; second, experiments on the role that norms, motivations, and incentives play in shaping behavior; third, experiments on political mobilization, social inﬂuence, and institutional effects; and fourth, experiments on prejudice and discrimination. We discuss methodological issues concerning generalizability and scalability as well as ethical issues related to ﬁeld experimental methods. We conclude by arguing that ﬁeld experiments are well equipped to advance the kind of middle-range theorizing that sociologists value.",

		"abstract": "Recent methods to improve generalizations from nonrandom samples typically invoke assumptions such as the strong ignorability of sample selection, which is challenging to meet in practice. Although researchers acknowledge the difﬁculty in meeting this assumption, point estimates are still provided and used without considering alternative assumptions. We compare the point identifying assumption of strong ignorability of sample selection with two alternative assumptions—bounded sample variation and monotone treatment response—that partially identify the parameter of interest, yielding interval estimates. Additionally, we explore the role that population data frames play in contributing identifying power for the interval estimates. We situate the comparison around causal generalization with nonrandom samples by applying the assumptions to a cluster randomized trial in education. Bounds on the population average treatment effect are derived under the alternative assumptions and the case when no assumptions are made on the data. While comparing the bounds, we discuss the plausibility of each alternative assumption and the practical trade-offs. We highlight the importance of thoughtfully considering the role that assumptions play in causal generalization by illustrating the differences in inferences from different assumptions.",

We investigate whether the same holds for a test that has no personal relevance for the students taking it (“low-stakes test”). More specifically, we explore whether student performance on the reading and mathematics assessments of the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) can be fostered by coaching (and administering a pretest). Coaching and pretest effects were studied for each content domain separately in a pre/posttest quasi-experimental design. To examine differential effects of academic tracks, samples were drawn from German Hauptschule and Gymnasium schools. Results show that only the combined effects of pretesting and coaching have substantial positive effects on student performance.

Here, optimal means maximizing power for a given budget or minimizing total cost for a given power. The problems of cluster size variation and speciﬁcation of the ICC of the outcome are solved in a simple yet efﬁcient way.\nResults: The optimal number of clusters goes up, and the optimal sample size per cluster goes down as the ICC goes up or as the cluster-to-person cost ratio goes down. The available budget, desired power, and effect size only affect the number of clusters and not the sample size per cluster, which is between 7 and 70 for a wide range of cost ratios and ICCs. Power loss because of cluster size variation is compensated by sampling 10% more clusters. The optimal design for the ICC halfway the range of realistic ICC values is a good choice for the ﬁrst stage of a two-stage design. The second stage is needed only if the ﬁrst stage shows the ICC to be higher than assumed.\nConclusion: Efﬁcient sample sizes for cluster randomized trials are easily computed, provided the cost per cluster and cost per person are speciﬁed.",

Lab-work learning environments in which students get direct (‘‘hands-on”) experience with science content that is related to their everyday lives are posited to have positive effects on state/trait motivation and achievement, but there is a lack of sound empirical evidence to support this claim. In the present study, the effectiveness of a lab-work learning unit on the topic of ‘‘the chemistry of starch” was examined by applying a cluster randomized ﬁeld study with three treatment conditions with lab-work elements and a control group. The ﬁrst group was taught with labwork elements in School only, the second group (SCOL & school) was taught in a combined condition encompassing both a SCOL (Science Center Outreach Lab) visit and classroom learning, the third group was taught entirely outside the school environment (SCOL only), and the fourth group was a wait-list control group, which was not exposed to a ‘‘starch” curriculum at the time of this study. Data from 1854 students were gathered in 67 ninth-grade classes on state motivation during the intervention and on trait motivation and achievement at pretest, posttest, and follow-up. Multilevel regression analyses revealed several differences between the lab-work conditions and the control group: Whereas the hands-on practical approach effectively enhanced state motivation with positive effects on joy, situational interest, situational competence, and reduced boredom in all three treatment conditions (School only, SCOL & school, and SCOL only), there were differences in trait effects: learning at school (School only and SCOL &school) increased achievement (posttest and follow-up), whereas the SCOL visit resulted in a small and spurious increase in trait motivation (reduced cost and increased competence beliefs only on the posttest).",

We tested the assumption that intellectual development in participants of higher versus lower intellectual ability should follow different paths in that the gap between the two groups would widen as a function of time. Indicators of intellectual and cognitive development included verbal and nonverbal intelligence and logical reasoning, as well as measures of reading, spelling, and mathematics. The assessment interval ranged from the preschool period (4-year-olds) to late adolescence (17-year-olds). The relevant groups of intellectually more or less able participants were formed by those LOGIC children who later ended up in the high versus low educational tracks. In accord with a previous study (Schneider, Knopf & Stefanek, 2002), evidence for the widening gap between the two groups was rare and was restricted to verbal intelligence, formal reasoning, and spelling. For all remaining measures, reliable group differences were already found at the first measurement point (age 4) and did not change much over time. Overall, the findings did not provide much support for the assumption that intellectual development should be shaped by different educational contexts.",

Therefore it is assumed that higher track schools provide better learning environments and consequently pre-existing differences in cognitive competences between schools with lower and higher academic track increase. The analyses are based on a total of N = 922 students from the Bamberg BiKS-Study (Study on Educational Processes, Competence Development and Selection Decisions in Pre- and Primary School Age). The results provide evidence for growing performance differences in secondary school in the domain of reading competence but not for vocabulary. Furthermore, evidence of a widening gap in reading competence could be proven for the same students in the single tracked primary school, indicating the importance of individual factors for the explanation of fan-spread effects.

There is wide agreement that beyond academic teaching, schools play an important role in shaping schoolchildren’s character, imparting in them values such as curiosity, achievement, benevolence, and citizenship. Despite the importance of this topic, we know very little about whether and how schools affect children’s values. In this large-scale longitudinal study, we examined school principals’ roles in the development of children’s values. We hypothesized that relationships exist between principals’ values and changes in children’s values through the mediating effect of the school climate. To test our predictions, we collected data from 252 school principals, 3,658 teachers, and 49,401 schoolchildren. A multilevel structural-equation-modeling analysis yielded overall support for our hypotheses. These findings contribute to understanding the development of children’s values and the far-reaching impact of leaders’ values. They also de...",

		"abstract": "This paper provides practical guidance for researchers who are designing and analyzing studies that randomize schools—which comprise three levels of clustering (students in classrooms in schools)—to measure intervention effects on student academic outcomes when information on the middle level (classrooms) is missing. This situation arises frequently in practice because many available data sets identify the schools that students attend but not the classrooms in which they are taught. Do studies conducted under these circumstances yield results that are substantially different from what they would have been if this information had been available? The paper first considers this problem in the context of planning a school randomized study based on preexisting two-level information about how academic outcomes for students vary across schools and across students within schools (but not across classrooms in schools). The paper next considers this issue in the context of estimating intervention effects from school-randomized studies. Findings are based on empirical analyses of four multisite data sets using academic outcomes for students within classrooms within schools. The results indicate that in almost all situations one will obtain nearly identical results whether or not the classroom or middle level is omitted when designing or analyzing studies.",

		"abstract": "Methods for constructing confidence intervals for the variance components from a random\neffects model have important applications in a variety of disciplines. A fundamental analysis\nwith random effects models is confidence intervals for the variance components or functions of\nthe variance components. Many methods for constructing confidence intervals are currently\nbeing used. These methods work well under normality, equal variance, and equal sample size,\nbut are very sensitive to any violations of these assumptions. This dissertation addresses\nthe problem of constructing confidence intervals for variance components when the random\neffects or the errors are not normally distributed. The focus is on balanced one way random\neffects models and four parameters - the between group variance, the ratio of between to\nwithin group variance components, the intra-class correlation, and the \\stepped-up\" reliability\n- are examined. All of our proposed methods replace the usual estimate of the standard\nerror calculated under the assumption of normality with an estimate calculated under nonnormality.\nFor the between group variance, this estimate includes an estimate of the kurtosis\nof the distribution of the random effect. For the other three parameters, the standard error\nestimate includes estimates of both the kurtosis of the distribution of the random effect and\nthe kurtosis of the distribution of the errors. If the researcher does not have any information\nabout the distribution of the random e ects or the errors, a general kurtosis estimate is used\nwhich is based on Pearson's kurtosis estimator, but with adjustments suggested by Bonett and\nShoemaker. If it seems reasonable to assume the random effect or the errors follow a Beta\nor Gamma distribution, the kurtosis is estimated by first estimating the parameters of these\ndistributions and then using the parameter estimates to estimate the kurtosis. If a previous\nstudy has been conducted, kurtosis estimates from the previous study can be pooled with the\nkurtosis estimates from the current study. Finally, if the researcher can theoretically specify a\nkurtosis value based on expert knowledge about their field of study, this specified kurtosis value can be used in place of an estimate. Our findings indicate that the proposed methods, especially\nthose that incorporate a researcher's knowledge about the distributions of the random effect\nand the errors, perform better than the current methods when the normality assumption is\nviolated.",

		"abstract": "Randomized experiments, the most rigorous methodology for testing causal explanations for phenomena in the social sciences, are experiencing a resurgence in political science. The classic experimental design randomly assigns the population of interest into two groups, treatment and control. Ex ante these two groups should have identical distributions in terms of their observed and unobserved characteristics. Treatment is administered based on assignment, and by the assumptions of the Rubin causal model, the average effect of the treatment is calculated as the difference between the average outcome in the group assigned to treatment and the average outcome in the group assigned to control.\n\nRandomized experiments are often conducted within a multilevel setting. These settings can be defined at the level at which the randomization occurs, as well as at the level at which the treatment is both directly and indirectly administered. These indirect effects most often occur as a result of social transmission of the treatment, which is particularly likely when the treatment consists of information. This chapter explores the implications of these multilevel settings to highlight the importance of careful experimental design with respect to random assignment of the population and the implementation of the treatment. There are potential problems with analysis in this context, and this chapter suggests strategies to accommodate multilevel settings. These problems are most likely to occur in field settings where control is lacking, although they can sometimes occur in other settings as well.",

However, there are contexts where it may be possible to design a CRCT with a much smaller number of clusters (10 or fewer) and still detect meaningful effects.Objectives:The objective is to offer recommendations for best practices in design and analysis for small CRCTs.Research design:I use simulations to examine alternative design and analysis approaches. Specifically, I examine (1) which analytic approaches control Type I errors at the desired rate, (2) which design and analytic approaches yield the most power, (3) what is the design effect of spurious correlations, and (4) examples of specific scenarios under which impacts of different sizes can be detected with high probability.Results/Conclusions:I find that (1) mixed effects modeling and using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) on data aggregated to the cluster level both control the Type I error rate, (2) randomization within blocks is always recommended, but how best to account for blocking through covariate adjustment depends on whether the precision gains offset the degrees of freedom loss, (3) power calculations can be accurate when design effects from small sample, spurious correlations are taken into account, and (4) it is very difficult to detect small effects with just four clusters, but with six or more clusters, there are realistic circumstances under which small effects can be detected with high probability.",

		"abstract": "Accountability systems in education generally include indicators of student performance. However, these indicators often differ considerably among the various systems. More and more countries try to include value-added measures, mainly because they do not want to hold schools accountable for differences in their initial intake of students. This study presents a conceptual framework of these value-added measures, resulting in an overview of 5 different types. Using data from Dutch secondary schools, we empirically provide estimates of these different measures. Our analyses show that the correlation between the different types of school effects estimated is rather high, but that the different models implicate different results for individual schools. Based on theoretical considerations, arguments are given to use the following indicators in the value-added accountability models: prior achievement, student-level background characteristics, and compositional characteristics of the student population.",

This cross-sectional survey of English adults included data on a range of lifestyle risk factors and health outcomes. For the survey, households were sampled in 720 postal code sectors nested within 177 district health authorities and 14 regional health authorities. Study subjects were adults aged 16 years or more. ICCs and components of variance were estimated from a nested random-effects analysis of variance. Results are presented at the district health authority, postal code sector, and household levels. Between-cluster variation was evident at each level of clustering. In these data, ICCs were inversely related to cluster size, but design effects could be substantial when the cluster size was large. Most ICCs were below 0.01 at the district health authority level, and they were mostly below 0.05 at the postal code sector level. At the household level, many ICCs were in the range of 0.0–0.3. These data may provide useful information for the design of epidemiologic studies in which the units sampled or allocated range in size from households to large administrative areas.

		"abstract": "This paper makes an in-depth comparison of the PISA (OECD) and TIMSS (IEA) mathematics assessments conducted in 2003. First, a comparison of survey methodologies is presented, followed by an examination of the mathematics frameworks in the two studies. The methodologies and the frameworks in the two studies form the basis for providing explanations for the observed differences in PISA and TIMSS results. At the country level, it appears that Western countries perform relatively better in PISA as compared to their performance in TIMSS. In contrast, Asian and Eastern European countries tend to do better in TIMSS than in PISA. This paper goes beyond making mere conjectures about the observed differences in results between PISA and TIMSS. The paper provides supporting evidence through the use of regression analyses to explain the differences. The analyses showed that performance differences at the country level can be attributed to the content balance of the two tests, as well as the sampling definitions –age-based and grade-based – in PISA and TIMSS respectively. Apart from mathematics achievement, the paper also compares results from the two studies on measures of self-confidence in mathematics. Gender differences are also examined in the light of contrasting results from the two studies. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive comparison between PISA and TIMSS, and, in doing so, it throws some light on the interpretation of results of large-scale surveys more generally.",

The aim of the article is to address some substantive analysis questions in the SIMS data and show the potential of multilevel factor analysis methodology. Issues related to between- and within-class decomposition of achieve- ment variance and the change of this decomposition over the course of the eighth grade are studied. As a starting point, random effects ANOVA is considered for each achievement score. Each score contains a large amount of measurement error. The effects of unreliability on variance decomposition are shown with the help of a multilevel factor analysis model. Unreliability has severely distorting effects on this type of ANOVA while multilevel factor analysis gives results corresponding to what would be obtained with perfectly reliable scores.",

The data consisted of a subsample of 10,187 students in 160 high schools from High School and Beyond. Hierarchical linear modeling techniques were used to investigate the effect of the normative environment and academic organization of high schools on four social distribution parameters related to mathematics achievement. High average achievement is related to school social composition and to the school's academic emphasis. Although a smaller gap between the achievement of minority and white students is associated with an orderly school climate, less differentiation by social class and academic background are associated with smaller school size, less variability in course taking in mathematics, and a fair and effective disciplinary clima",

The school characteristics considered in cluded indicators of school organization, context, and climate. The subjects were 2,356 Black male students and White male students in 76 elementary schools. The results indicated that al though classroom participation was a significant predictor of achievement for both groups, the strength of the association was affected by school characteristics for the Black males only. In particular, the ability of Black males to translate academic par ticipation into achievement was weakened in large schools and in schools in which most students were from low socioeconomic backgrounds. It was concluded that in those settings, Black male students may be at a disadvantage.",

		"abstract": "Since the early 1900's, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) has been used to quantify the level of agreement among different assessments on the same object. By comparing the level of variability that exists within subjects to the overall error, a measure of the agreement among the different assessments can be calculated. Historically, this has been performed using subject as the only random effect. However, there are many cases where other nested effects, such as site, should be controlled for when calculating the ICC to determine the chance corrected agreement adjusted for other nested factors. We will present a unified framework to estimate both the two-level and three-level ICC for both binomial and multinomial outcomes. In addition, the corresponding standard errors and confidence intervals for both ICC measurements will be displayed. Finally, an example of the effect that controlling for site can have on ICC measures will be presented for subjects nested within genotyping plates comparing genetically determined race to patient reported race.",

The major research questions concerneda) how the simulation design factors affect (multilevel variance inflation factor) MVIF, b) how MVIF affects standard errors of regression coefficients, and c) how MVIF affects significance of regression coefficients.Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to address these questions. Predictor relationships were manipulated inorder to simulate multicollinearity. Findings indicate that a) increases in relationships among Level 1 predictors and also relationships among Level 2 predictors led to increased MVIF for those specific variables, b) as MVIF increases for a predictor, the standard errors for the regression coefficients also increase., and c) when MVIF values for the regression coefficients were 5 or higher, margins of error were around .20, and therefore any coefficients around .20 or lower will become non-significant.",

However, Schochet (2008a) estimated that, on average, an RDD study of an education intervention would need to include three to four times as many schools or students as an RCT to produce impacts with the same level of statistical precision. We extend the work of Schochet by empirically assessing the effect on sample size requirements of accounting for selection of an optimal bandwidth and the adjustment for random misspecification error, both of which are needed to estimate consistent RDD impacts and control the Type I error rate. We used data from four previously published education studies covering more than 25,000 students in kindergarten to grade 9 in 24 states and 330 schools to calculate empirical estimates of the RDD design effect taking into account these additional factors. We find that an RDD study needs between 9 and 17 times as many schools or students as an RCT to produce an impact with the same level of statistical precision, and that the need for a large sample is driven primarily by bandwidth selection, not adjusting for random misspecification error.

Investigators are urged to publish the cluster-specific event rates observed in their trials as a guide for the planning of future studies.",

The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the\nspecified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which\nthe Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences\nof this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data\nmechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models.\nThe results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate\ncoverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is\nthat these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from\nobserved marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual\nperformance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and\ntherefore deserves further study.",

The authors identified the appropriate experimental design and estimated the minimum detectable standardized effect size (MDES) for each study under plausible assumptions about intra-class correlations, covariate-outcome correlations, and explanatory effects of blocking. The MDESs ranged from .18 to .40 for studies funded by the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) and from .20 to 1.0 for studies funded by the National Center for Education Research (NCER). They evaluated the technical accuracy by comparing the estimated MDES to the MDES stated in the proposal. Studies funded by the NCEE tended to be very accurate: estimated MDESs and stated MDESs were similar, whereas studies funded by the NCER were less accurate. However, the technical accuracy of the NCER studies improved over time.",

Though methodologists have consistently warned of the formidable inferential problems such data pose for traditional statistical methods, no comprehensive alternative analytic strategy has been available. This paper presents a general statistical methodology for such hierarchically structured data and illustrates its use by reexamining the High School and Beyond data and the controversy over the effectiveness of public and Catholic schools. The model enables the researcher to utilize mean achievement and certain structural parameters that characterize the equity in the social distribution of achievement as multivariate outcomes for each school. Variation in these school-level outcomes is then explained as a function of school characteristics.",

Learning about such a distribution involves estimating its mean value, detecting and quantifying its variation, and estimating site-specific impacts. Learning from such a distribution involves studying the factors that predict or explain impact variation. Part I of the article introduces the concepts and issues involved. Part II focuses on estimating the mean and variation of impacts of program assignment. Part III extends the discussion to variation in the impacts of program participation. Part IV considers how to use multisite trials to study moderators of program impacts (individual-level or site-level factors that influence these impacts) and mediators of program impacts (individual-level or site-level ‘‘mechanisms’’ that produce these impacts).",

Its position as an integrated program within the SAS statistical package makes it an ideal choice for empirical researchers and applied statisticians seeking to do data reduction, management, and analysis within a single statistical package. Because the program was developed from the perspective of a “mixed” statistical model with both random and fixed effects, its syntax and programming logic may appear unfamiliar to users in education and the social and behavioral sciences who tend to express these models as multilevel or hierarchical models. The purpose of this paper is to help users familiar with fitting multilevel models using other statistical packages (e.g., HLM, MLwiN, MIXREG) add SAS PROC MIXED to their array of analytic options. The paper is written as a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to fit the two most common multilevel models: (a) school effects models, designed for data on individuals nested within naturally occurring hierarchies (e.g., students within classes); and (b) individual growth models, designed for exploring longitudinal data (on individuals) over time. The conclusion discusses how these ideas can be extended straighforwardly to the case of three level models. An appendix presents general strategies for working with multilevel data in SAS and for creating data sets at several levels.",

Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey of 1988 and a new form of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), this study focuses on dropouts from middle school and examines the issue from both individual and institutional perspectives. At the individual level, the results identified a number of family and school experience factors that influence the decision to leave school, with grade retention being the single most powerful predictor. But disaggregating the analysis also revealed that there are widespread differences in the effects of these factors on White, Black, and Hispanic students. At the institutional level, the results revealed that mean dropout rates vary widely between schools and that most of the variation can be explained by differences in the background characteristics of students. But restricting the analysis to lower SES schools shows widespread differences in both mean dropout rates and social class differentiation among such schools. Moreover, much of the variation among those schools can be explained by social composition of students and by several structural features of schools and school climate.",

To provide this picture, a meta-analysis was performed on 22 studies which investigate gender differences in learning orientations. The studies used N. J. Entwistle's Approaches to Studying Inventory (ASI), and were conducted in a variety of higher education settings. Results of these studies were analysed in a multilevel approach with two levels: the respondents are nested within studies. Results show significant mean gender differences on the Reproduction Orientation (women score higher), and on the Non-academic Orientation (men score higher). Furthermore, gender differences appeared on 11 of 16 scales (e.g., relating ideas, operational learning, fear of failure, negative attitude to studying, extrinsic motivation). The effect scores of 10 of 16 scales of the ASI are heterogeneous. The observed variation in gender differences across studies could not be explained by the small number of available study characteristics. More research is needed which explores factors in the educational context \"responsible\" for the magnitude and direction of gender differences in learning orientations.

The current study aims to extend the existing information for the plausible range of ICC values in educational achievement outcomes to a global scale by examining the distributional characteristics of two-level unconditional ICC estimates across countries participating in two international studies, TIMSS and PIRLS. The findings suggest large variability in the unconditional ICC estimates across countries, and current standards do not apply to every country.

This study proposes the use of finite mixture models to evaluate whether interventions, and, specifically, group randomized trials, impact participants with certain characteristics or levels of problem behaviors. This study uses latent classes defined by clustering of individuals based on the targeted behaviors and illustrates the model by testing whether a preventive intervention aimed at reducing problem behaviors affects experimental users of illicit substances differently than problematic substance users or those individuals engaged in more serious problem behaviors. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the identification of latent classes, specification of random effects in a multilevel mixture model, independent validation of latent classes, and the estimation of power for the proposed models to detect intervention effects. This study proposes specific steps for the estimation of multilevel mixture models and their power and suggests that this model can be applied more broadly to understand the effectiveness of interventions.",

		"abstract": "This paper provides practical guidance for researchers who are designing studies that randomize groups to measure the impacts of interventions on children. To do so, the paper: (1) provides new empirical information about the values of parameters that influence the precision of impact estimates (intra-class correlations and R-squares); (2) examines the implications of planning group-randomized studies for three-level hierarchical situations, using empirical information obtained by estimating two-level hierarchical models (which under many conditions appears to not be problematic); and (3) assesses the implications of the uncertainty that exists when the design of group-randomized studies is based on estimates of intra-class correlations. Data for the paper come from two studies: the Chicago Literacy Initiative: Making Better Early Readers study (CLIMBERs) and the School Break-fast Pilot Project (SBPP). The analysis sample from CLIMBERs comprised 430 4-year old children from 47 preschool classrooms in 23 Chicago public schools. The analysis sample from the SBPP study comprised 1,151 third-graders from 233 classrooms in 111 schools in six school districts. Four appendixes are included: (1) Description of Outcome Measures; (2) Definition of the Multiplier M; (3) Complete Set of Results for Three-Level vs. Two-Level Model Comparisons: Nonstandardized Unconditional Variance Components; and (4) Proofs of the Relationship between Three-Level Models and Two-Level Models in Terms of Precision.

In this paper, we provide a unified treatment of ICC as used in CRTs. We present a general definition of the ICC that may be expressed in different ways depending on the modelling approach used to describe the data, illustrating how this general definition is applied to continuous and dichotomous outcomes. Greater complexity arises for dichotomous outcomes; in particular, the usual definition of the ICC cannot be related directly to the parameters of the logistic-normal model that is commonly used for dichotomous outcomes. We show how the definition of the ICC is different when covariates are introduced. Finally, we use our framework and definition of the ICC to draw out implications for those interpreting and choosing values of the ICC when planning CRTs.",

In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the inﬂuence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefﬁcients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the inﬂuence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefﬁcients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.",

For example, interventions are randomly assigned to the clusters (level three unit). Health care professionals (level two unit) within the same cluster are trained with the randomly assigned intervention to provide care to subjects (level one unit). In this study, we derived a closed form power function and formulae for sample size determination required to detect an intervention eﬀect on outcomes at the subject’s level. In doing so, we used a test statistic based on maximum likelihood estimates from a mixed-eﬀects linear regression model for three level data. A simulation study follows and veriﬁes that theoretical power estimates based on the derived formulae are nearly identical to empirical estimates based on simulated data. Recommendations at the design stage of a cluster-RCT are discussed.",

Short-term and sustained effects (6 weeks and 5 months after the intervention) of the two intervention conditions on students’ competence beliefs (self-concept, homework self-efficacy), teacher-rated individual effort, and standardized test scores in mathematics were assessed. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that students’ homework self-efficacy was higher in both intervention groups 6 weeks and 5 months after the intervention compared to the control condition.

		"abstract": "This review examines recent advances in sample size planning, not only from the perspective of an individual researcher, but also with regard to the goal of developing cumulative knowledge. Psychologists have traditionally thought of sample size planning in terms of power analysis. Although we review recent advances in power analysis, our main focus is the desirability of achieving accurate parameter estimates, either instead of or in addition to obtaining sufﬁcient power. Accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE) has taken on increasing importance in light of recent emphasis on effect size estimation and formation of conﬁdence intervals. The review provides an overview of the logic behind sample size planning for AIPE and summarizes recent advances in implementing this approach in designs commonly used in psychological research.",

		"abstract": "With cluster randomized trials complete groups of subjects are randomized to treatment conditions. An important question might be whether and when the subjects experience a particular event, such as smoking initiation or recovery from disease. In the social sciences the timing of such events is often measured in discrete time by using time intervals. At the planning phase of a cluster randomized trial one should decide on the number of clusters and cluster size such that parameters are estimated accurately and sufﬁcient power on the test on treatment effect is achieved. On basis of a simulation study it is concluded that regression coefﬁcients are estimated more accurately than the variance of the random cluster effect. In addition, it is shown that power increases with cluster size and number of clusters, and that a sufﬁcient power cannot always be achieved by using larger cluster sizes at a ﬁxed number of clusters.",

		"abstract": "The American Psychological Association (APA) Task Force on Statistical Inference was formed in 1996 in response to a growing body of research demonstrating methodological issues that threatened the credibility of psychological research, and made recommendations to address them. One issue was the small, even dramatically inadequate, size of samples used in studies published by leading journals. The present study assessed the progress made since the Task Force’s final report in 1999. Sample sizes reported in four leading APA journals in 1955, 1977, 1995, and 2006 were compared using nonparametric statistics, while data from the last two waves were fit to a hierarchical generalized linear growth model for more in-depth analysis. Overall, results indicate that the recommendations for increasing sample sizes have not been integrated in core psychological research, although results slightly vary by field. This and other implications are discussed in the context of current methodological critique and practice.",

The AIPE approach yields precise estimates of population parameters by providing necessary sample sizes in order for the likely widths of confidence intervals to be sufficiently narrow. One AIPE method yields a sample size such that the expected width of the confidence interval around the standardized population regression coefficient is equal to the width specified. An enhanced formulation ensures, with some stipulated probability, that the width of the confidence interval will be no larger than the width specified. Issues involving standardized regression coefficients and random predictors are discussed, as are the philosophical differences between AIPE and the power analytic approaches to sample size planning.",

In the standard RD design, individuals with rating scores higher than some exogenously determined cutoff score are assigned to one treatment condition; those with rating scores below the cutoff score are assigned to an alternate treatment condition. Many education policies, however, assign treatment status on the basis of more than one rating-score dimension. We refer to this class of RD designs as “multiple rating score regression discontinuity” (MRSRD) designs. In this paper, we discuss ﬁve different approaches to estimating treatment effects using MRSRD designs (response surface RD; frontier RD; fuzzy frontier RD; distance-based RD; and binding-score RD). We discuss differences among them in terms of their estimands, applications, statistical power, and potential extensions for studying heterogeneity of treatment effects.",

NEPS is the first study aiming to examine ICT literacy longitudinally across the lifespan using objective paper-pencil test instruments. To do so, it is necessary to develop reliable and valid test instruments that are capable of assessing ICT literacy longitudinally. On the basis of an assessment framework, we developed in an initial step an item pool for assessing the ICT literacy of secondary school students and tested the item pool in three pilot studies (Grade 5, 7 and 9). The item and scale analyses provided satisfying results and the item pool proved to be suitable for assessing ICT literacy longitudinally. In addition, validity analyses showed a satisfactory content validity and a high test fairness with regard to gender and school type. Concerning criterion validity, there were expected correlations with variables of computer familiarity. (DIPF/Orig.)",

Die meisten Erwachsenen haben laut Umfrage in ihrem Alltag schon ueber Sprache nachgedacht, sei es in einer konkreten Kommunikationssituation oder im Rahmen der allgemeinen Diskussion ueber einen drohenden Sprachverfall. Bereits kleine Kinder kommen mit dem Spracherwerb zu metasprachlichen Erklaerungen und Hypothesenbildungen. Aufgabe der Schule sollte es sein, dieses Vorwissen in den Unterricht zu integrieren und systematisch weiterzubilden. In der Praxis hat jedoch immer noch die abstrakte Wissenschaftssystematik Vorrang vor der Handlungsrelevanz der Inhalte. Dies ist um so bedauerlicher, als das so erworbene theoretische Grammatikwissen nach der Schulzeit relativ schnell wieder verloren geht, wie Untersuchungen zeigen. Wuenschenswert sind darum eine neue Diskussion zum Thema Reflexion ueber Sprache und neue didaktische Konzepte. In einer knappen Uebersicht werden Aufsaetze, die das Heft dazu bietet, kurz vorgestellt.",

Insbesondere die Schuldzuweisung an die Jugend und somit auch an die Schule kann auf eine lange Tradition als Argumentationsmuster zurueckblicken. Konkrete Veraenderungen in den sprachlichen Anforderungen werden als moegliche Ursachen eines Sprachwandels jedoch kaum bedacht. Die Lingusitik hat ihrerseits aufgrund der ueberwiegend deskriptiven Ausrichtung bislang erst wenig wissenschaftlich begruendete Erklaerungs- und Bewertungsmoeglichkeiten zur Verfuegung gestellt, die fuer einen differenzierten sprachkritischen Umgang mit Sprachwandelphaenomenen noetig waeren. Auch fuer den schulischen Sprachunterricht bildet dies eine wichtige Voraussetzung, um die Sprachfoerderung den gestiegenen Anforderungen anzupassen, und zwar insbesondere durch das Lernziel der inneren Mehrsprachigkeit.",

Der SRT basiert auf einem theoretischen Rahmenkonzept, das auf Ergebnissen der linguistischen Graphematik aufbaut und mit Daten aus Querschnittstudien empirisch validiert wurde. Für den Einsatz in der Längsschnittstudie NEPS wurde der SRT zur Kompetenzmessung in der Sekundarstufe I weiterentwickelt, um geeignete längsschnittliche Testinstrumente zu entwickeln und adäquate Verfahren für die Modellierung der Rechtschreibkompetenz zu finden. Dazu wurden im Sinne interdisziplinärer Forschung empirische und didaktische Erkenntnisse für die quantitative Datenanalyse mit Testdaten aus den Klassenstufen 5 bis 7 kombiniert.",

Das SLS 5-8 erhebt die Lesegeschwindigkeit mittels einer natürlichen Leseanforderung: dem Lesen von sinnvollen Sätzen. Eine Liste inhaltlich einfacher Sätze, die auf das Wissen der Schülerinnen und Schüler abgestimmt wurden, muss möglichst schnell gelesen und der Wahrheitswert jedes Satzes beurteilt werden. Das SLS 5-8 ist ein ökonomisch einsetzbares Verfahren, da es mit allen Schülerinnen und Schülern einer Klasse gleichzeitig durchgeführt werden kann. Wie beim SLS 1-4 liegen auch beim SLS 5-8 zwei Parallelformen mit unterschiedlichen, hinsichtlich der Leseanforderungen vergleichbaren Sätzen vor. Jede der beiden Satzversionen gibt es in zwei Varianten mit leicht unterschiedlicher Reihenfolge der Sätze. Mit den unterschiedlichen Satzversionen kann der Test auch in kurzen Abständen wiederholt werden. Unter Verwendung der beiden Abfolgevarianten kann in der gesamten Klasse dieselbe Satzversion verwendet werden, ohne dass ein Abschreiben vom Nachbarn möglich ist.",

It gives a detailed presentation of the two central dimensions in the framework: (a) text functions and text types and (b) the cognitive requirements of reading tasks. These are discussed against the background of relevant theoretical models and research findings. A pilot study of 447 adults is reported that analyzed the dimensionality and difficulty of the reading competence test for adults. Results indicated that the test meets the NEPS research goals. The article focuses particularly on whether text types and cognitive requirements prove to be appropriate structural elements for the framework, that is, whether each distinguishes sufficiently between good and poor readers. Results also report on the dimensionality of the reading competence test. A comparison between one unidimensional and two different multidimensional models examined whether the text types and/or cognitive requirements of the items/tasks are separate dimensions of reading competence, or whether the reading competence measured in NEPS can – as intended - be conceived as a unidimensional construct. Results are discussed against the background of the scope and limitations of the NEPS reading competence test and the relevant research literature on reading competence. (DIPF/Orig.)",

Dies ist eine Weiterentwicklung komparativer Untersuchungen, die bisher eher von einem deskriptiv bestimmten Kerncurriculum ausgingen. PISA stellt daher den Begriff „literacy“ ins Zentrum. „Mathematical literacy” baut in PISA auf mathematikdidaktischen Modellen und Forderungen auf, die zunächst dargestellt werden. Im nationalen Ergänzungstest in Deutschland wurde der Begriff „mathematical literacy“ ausdifferenziert und erweitert zu einem auch in der deutschen Allgemeinbildungsdiskussion zu verankernden Begriff „mathematischer Grundbildung“. Dieser konkretisiert sich in der Forderung, dass ausgewogene Performanz in drei Typen mathematischen Arbeitens erreicht werden soll, in den technischen Fertigkeiten sowie bei re chnerisch bzw. begrifflich orientierten Modellierungs-und Problemlöseaufgaben. Diese Beschreibung mathematischer Grundbildung erlaubt es, die PISA-Daten inhaltlich nach mehreren Gesichtspunkten hin zu interpretieren, so dass auch die praktische Relevanz von PISA deutlich werden kann. Die bisherigen Interpretationsansätze werden abschließend kurz vorgestellt.",

He provides a survey of approaches to varieties of language, and considers these in relation to communication and task-based language learning. Swales outlines an approach to the analysis of genre, and then proceeds to consider examples of different genres and how they can be made accessible through genre analysis. This is important reading for all those working in teaching English for academic purposes and also of interest to those working in post-secondary writing and composition due to relevant issues in writing across the curriculum.",

Each dimension comprises a set of lexical and syntactic features that cooccur frequently in texts, reflecting underlying shared communicative functions. Eight text types are identified with respect to these dimensions; each type represents a grouping of texts that are markedly similar to one another with respect to their dimension characterizations. Although the linguistic variation among texts is continuous, there are only a few linguistic characterizations that occur frequently, and the text types identified here represent the prototypical groups of texts having these characterizations. The types are interpreted by considering their predominant linguistic features and the general communicative characteristics of the texts grouped in each type, and by performing microanalyses of particular texts. Based on these interpretations, functional labels, such as ‘Informational interaction’, ‘Learned exposition’, and ‘Involved persuasion’, are proposed for each type.",

It is here reissued with a fresh introduction that surveys the considerable literature in linguistics, psychology and the social sciences that the original extended essay stimulated, and suggests distinct directions for research. The authors describe and account for some remarkable parallelisms in the linguistic construction of utterances with which people express themselves in different languages and cultures. A motive for these parallels is isolated and a universal model is constructed outlining the abstract principles underlying polite usages. This is based on the detailed study of three unrelated languages and cultures: the Tamil of South India, the Tzeltal spoken by Mayan Indians in Chiapas, Mexico, and the English of the USA and England.

There has recently been considerable interest in estimating intraclass correlations from surveys or designed experiments to provide design parameters for planning future large-scale randomized experiments. The large sample distribution of estimates of the intraclass correlation in two-level situations is well known. Contemporary educational and social experiments often involve sampling designs with three or four levels of nesting, leading to three- and four-level intraclass correlation structures.

		"abstract": "Background: Cluster-randomized experiments that assign intact groups such as schools or school districts to treatment conditions are increasingly common in educational research. Such experiments are inherently multilevel designs whose sensitivity (statistical power and precision of estimates) depends on the variance decomposition across levels. This variance decomposition is usually summarized by the intraclass correlation (ICC) structure and, if covariates are used, the effectiveness of the covariates in explaining variation at each level of the design.\nObjectives: This article provides a compilation of school- and district-level ICC values of academic achievement and related covariate effectiveness based on state longitudinal data systems. These values are designed to be used for planning group-randomized experiments in education. The use of these values to compute statistical power and plan two- and three-level group-randomized experiments is illustrated.\nResearch Design: We fit several hierarchical linear models to state data by grade and subject to estimate ICCs and covariate effectiveness. The total sample size is over 4.8 million students. We then compare our average of state estimates with the national work by Hedges and Hedberg.",

		"abstract": "Randomized experiments are often considered the strongest designs to study the impact of educational interventions. Perhaps the most prevalent class of designs used in large-scale education experiments is the cluster randomized design in which entire schools are assigned to treatments. In cluster randomized trials that assign schools to treatments within a set of school districts, the statistical power of the test for treatment effects depends on the within-district school-level intraclass correlation (ICC). Hedges and Hedberg (2014) recently computed within-district ICC values in 11 states using three-level models (students in schools in districts) that pooled results across all the districts within each state. Although values from these analyses are useful when working with a representative sample of districts, they may be misleading for other samples of districts because the magnitude of ICCs appears to be related to district size. To plan studies with small or nonrepresentative samples of districts, better information are needed about the relation of within-district school-level ICCs to district size.",

		"abstract": "Background: There is an increased focus on randomized trials for proximal behavioral outcomes in early childhood research. However, planning sample sizes for such designs requires extant information on the size of effect, variance decomposition, and effectiveness of covariates. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to employ a recent large representative sample of early childhood longitudinal study kindergartners to estimate design parameters for use in planning cluster randomized trials. A secondary objective is to compare the results of math and reading with the previous kindergartner cohort of 1999.Research Design: For each measure, fall? spring gains in effect size units are calculated. In addition, multilevel models are fit to estimate variance components that are used to calculate intraclass correlations (ICCs) and R2 statistics. The implications of the reported parameters are summarized in tables of required school sample sizes to detect small effects. Measures: The outcomes include information about student scores regarding learning behaviors, general behaviors, and academic abilities. Results: Aside from math and reading, there were small gains in these measures from fall to spring, leading to effect sizes between about .1 and .2. In addition, the nonacademic ICCs are smaller than the academic ICCs but are still nontrivial. Use of a pretest covariate is generally effective in reducing the required sample size in power analyses. The ICCs for math and reading are smaller for the current sample compared with the 1999 sample.",

		"abstract": "Cluster randomized trials (CRTs), or studies in which intact groups of individuals are randomly assigned to a condition, are becoming more common in the evaluation of educational programs, policies, and practices. The website for the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) reveals they have launched over 30 evaluation studies in the past decade, the majority of them utilizing a randomized trial. Clearly there are a large number of randomized trials of educational programs, policies, and practices either complete or currently in the field. The overarching goal of these randomized trials is generate rigorous evidence of whether or not a program works. In order to do this, studies must also be designed to detect moderator effects. The power to detect moderator effects at the student, cluster, or site level in CRTs has received much less attention in the literature than the power for the main effect of treatment. The purpose of this paper is to extend the work on power calculations for moderator effects to include moderator effects at any level for the following 4 types of CRTs: 2-level CRT, 3-level CRT, 3-level multi-site cluster randomized trial (MSCRT), and 4-level MSCRT. In addition to providing the calculations and R code to do the calculations, we start to develop intuition around the minimum detectable effect size for moderator effects using sample sizes from CRTs in the field of education. This paper represents the next step towards building the capacity of researchers to design CRTs that move beyond the main effect of treatment. Designing studies to detect not only whether or not an intervention works, but for whom or under what circumstances is critical. The results from this study suggest that in many cases, if a study is powered to detect a reasonable main effect of treatment and it has a reasonable number of individuals per cluster, then it will also be powered to detect an individual level moderator (although not shown in this proposal).",

The unit of intervention is then a cluster of individual patients or healthy subjects. Evaluation of cluster level interventions may be difficult because only a few units of large size may be available for study evaluation may be at either individual or cluster level, and individuals' responses may be correlated within clusters. At the design stage, it is important to randomise clusters whenever possble, adapt sample size calculations to allow for clustering of responses, and choose between cohort and repeated cross sectional designs.

		"abstract": "The capacity of the field to conduct power analyses for group randomized trials (GRTs) of educational interventions has improved over the past decade (Authors, 2009). However, a power analysis depends on estimates of design parameters. Hence it is critical to build the empirical base of design parameters for GRTs across a variety of outcomes and contexts. This study provides a first step towards building this base of design parameters specifically for science outcomes. Unlike reading and math, science is not typically tested each year. Preliminary findings from this study suggest that although not direct comparisons, unconditional intraclass correlations (ICCs) for science outcomes are smaller than grade 3 math and reading as reported by Bloom, Richburg-Hayes, and Black (2005; 2007) for five urban districts. Similarly, Hedges and Hedberg (2007) found larger ICCs for both reading and math using a nationally representative sample of students nested in schools. R-square values for school level covariates have not been computed yet, but a one year lagged student pretest appears to be highly effective in reducing variance between and within schools, more so than in reading (R-squares less than 0.86) and math (less than 0.63) as reported by Bloom et al. (2005; 2007). The empirical estimates from this study will help improve the accuracy of the power analyses for GRTs of science interventions. Tables are appended.",

		"abstract": "A cluster-randomized trial (CRT) relies on random assignment of intact clusters to treatment conditions, such as classrooms or schools (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). One specific type of CRT, a multi-site CRT (MSCRT), is commonly employed in educational research and evaluation studies (Spybrook & Raudenbush, 2009; Spybrook, 2014; Bloom, Richburg-Hayes, & Black, 2007). The three-level MSCRT is a nested design with the level-three units (or sites) treated as a blocking variable, and the level-two units randomly assigned to treatment and control within each site. As in all experimental studies, evaluators must design CRTs with appropriate power to detect an expected effect. A common challenge for evaluators planning CRTs is selecting an appropriate intraclass correlation (ICC), an estimate of the percentage of total variance that exists at the group level, to accurately power the study. For studies with more than one level of nesting, multiple ICCs must be estimated. This study aims to improve the design of MSCRTs for science achievement studies by producing estimates of within-district ICCs across all districts in an entire state. The following research questions guide this investigation: (1) What is the distribution of within-district ICCs for science education; and (2) Does the number of districts in an MSCRT affect the mean within-district ICC? The results of this study are from one large, and representative (in terms of the grades in which testing occurs) state. Educational systems in other states may be structured quite differently, and further work in this area is needed to empirically estimate design parameters for planning MSCRTs. It will also be useful to explore whether significant differences exist between mean within-district ICC values in higher grades. Tables and figures are appended.",

It also shares the reflections of the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences on the fit, and sometimes misfit, between the current activities of the education research community and the needs of practitioners and policy makers. The statutory mission of the Institute of Education Sciences is to provide decision makers and the general public with information on: (1) the condition and progress of education in the United States; (2) practices that improve academic achievement and access to education opportunities; and (3) the effectiveness of Federal and other education programs. These three functions are the responsibility of the organizational units of the Institute of Education Sciences: the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Center for Education Research, and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance. Both the statutory mission of the Institute and its conceptual model point it toward applied research. Consequently, the primary focus of the Institute of Education Sciences is on work that has a high consideration of usepractical, applied work that is relevant to practitioners and policy makers. The preponderance of issues identified as high priority areas that the Institute is addressing relate to questions of effectiveness. Such questions are addressed most rigorously with randomized field trials, considered the only sure method for determining the effectiveness of education programs and practices. Although randomized trials are the gold standard for determining what works, they are not appropriate for all questions, and can be enhanced with results from other methods. A look at recent education research has indicated that randomized trials represent only about 6% of the research reported in American Association of Educational Research journals, although they predominate in the \"Journal of Educational Psychology.\" These findings show a mismatch between what education decision makers want from research and what the education research community is providing. The Institute of Education Sciences is working to correct this mismatch through its focus on what works in education. (SLD)",

Issues related to between- and within-class decomposition of achieve- ment variance and the change of this decomposition over the course of the eighth grade are studied. As a starting point, random effects ANOVA is considered for each achievement score. Each score contains a large amount of measurement error. The effects of unreliability on variance decomposition are shown with the help of a multilevel factor analysis model. Unreliability has severely distorting effects on this type of ANOVA while multilevel factor analysis gives results corresponding to what would be obtained with perfectly reliable scores.",

		"abstract": "Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a buzzword in contemporary professional debates, for example, in education, medicine, psychiatry, and social policy. It is known as the “what works” agenda, and its focus is on the use of the best available evidence to bring about desirable results or prevent undesirable ones. We immediately see here that EBP is practical in nature, that evidence is thought to play a central role, and also that EBP is deeply causal: we intervene into an already existing practice in order to produce an output or to improve the output. If our intervention brings the results we want, we say that it “works.”\n            How should we understand the causal nature of EBP? Causality is a highly contentious issue in education, and many writers want to banish it altogether. But causation denotes a dynamic relation between factors and is indispensable if one wants to be able to plan the attainment of goals and results. A nuanced and reasonable understanding of causality is therefore necessary to EBP, and this we find in the INUS-condition approach.\n            The nature and function of evidence is much discussed. The evidence in question is supplied by research, as a response to both political and practical demands that educational research should contribute to practice. In general, evidence speaks to the truth value of claims. In the case of EBP, the evidence emanates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and presumably speaks to the truth value of claims such as “if we do X, it will lead to result Y.” But what does research evidence really tell us? It is argued here that a positive RCT result will tell you that X worked where the RCT was conducted and that an RCT does not yield general results.\n            \n              Causality and evidence come together in the practitioner perspective. Here we shift from\n              finding\n              causes to\n              using\n              them to bring about desirable results. This puts contextual matters at center stage: will X work in this particular context? It is argued that much heterogeneous contextual evidence is required to make X relevant for new contexts. If EBP is to be a success, research evidence and contextual evidence must be brought together.",

In this article, we examine the processes that lead to illusory ﬁndings and describe their consequences. We borrow from an approach used increasingly by other disciplines—the norm of preregistering studies. Speciﬁcally, we examine how this practice of publicly posting documentation of one’s prespeciﬁed hypotheses and other key decisions of a study prior to study implementation or data analysis could improve scientiﬁc integrity within education. In an attempt to develop initial guidelines to facilitate preregistrations in education, we discuss the types of studies that ought to be preregistered and the logistics of how educational researchers might execute preregistrations. We conclude with ideas for how researchers, reviewers, and the ﬁeld of education more broadly might speed the adoption of this new norm.",

Zu  ihrer Erfassung wurden Aufgaben zu allen in den Bildungsstandards (KMK, 2005) be-schriebenen  inhaltlichen  und  allgemeinen  Kompetenzbereichen  eingesetzt.  Die Ergebnisse werden sowohl für die einzelnen inhaltlichen Kompetenzbereiche als auch für eine globale Mathematikskala dargestellt, die die Aufgaben aus allen Bereichen zusammenfasst. Eine genauere Beschreibung der Struktur der inhalt-lichen Kompetenzbereiche sowie der globalen Mathematikskala ist in Kapitel 2.2 zu fi nden. In  Abschnitt  5.2.1  werden  zunächst  die  durchschnittlich  erreichten  Kom-petenzen der Schülerinnen und Schüler in den Ländern präsentiert, und es wird erläutert, wie sich diese zwischen den Ländern unterscheiden. Ferner werden die Unterschiede zwischen den Kompetenzständen auf der Globalskala und in den inhaltlichen  Kompetenzbereichen  für  die  einzelnen  Länder  dargestellt.  Daran anschließend  wird  in Abschnitt  5.2.2  die  Leistungsheterogenität  innerhalb  der Länder untersucht.",

		"abstract": "We consider the relative performance of two common approaches to multiple imputation (MI): joint multivariate normal (MVN) MI, in which the data are modeled as a sample from a joint MVN distribution; and conditional MI, in which each variable is modeled conditionally on all the others. In order to use the multivariate normal distribution, implementations of joint MVN MI typically assume that categories of discrete variables are probabilistically constructed from continuous values. We use simulations to examine the implications of these assumptions. For each approach, we assess (1) the accuracy of the imputed values; and (2) the accuracy of coefficients and fitted values from a model fit to completed data sets. These simulations consider continuous, binary, ordinal, and unordered-categorical variables. One set of simulations uses multivariate normal data, and one set uses data from the 2008 American National Election Studies. We implement a less restrictive approach than is typical when evaluating methods using simulations in the missing data literature: in each case, missing values are generated by carefully following the conditions necessary for missingness to be “missing at random” (MAR). We find that in these situations conditional MI is more accurate than joint MVN MI whenever the data include categorical variables.",

The power computations take into account clustering effects  at  the  classroom  and  at  the  school  level,  sample  size  effects  (e.g.,  number  of  students,  classrooms,  and  schools),  and  covariate  effects  (e.g.,  pre-treatment  measures).

Instead, one must develop empirical benchmarks of comparison that reﬂect the nature of the intervention being evaluated, its target population, and the outcome measure or measures being used. This approach is applied to the assessment of effect size measures for educational interventions designed to improve student academic achievement. Three types of empirical benchmarks are illustrated: (a) normative expectations for growth over time in student achievement, (b) policyrelevant gaps in student achievement by demographic group or school performance, and (c) effect size results from past research for similar interventions and target populations. The ﬁndings can be used to help assess educational interventions, and the process of doing so can provide guidelines for how to develop and use such benchmarks in other ﬁelds.",

Previous research found positive eﬀects of an ipsative frame of reference on students’ achievement and achievement motivation. In the present study we investigated the generalizability of previous results with longitudinal data (9th and 10th grade) from the COACTIV study (NStudents = 2,465; NTeachers = 106). The teacher frame of reference was assessed by means of a multi-method approach to study the diﬀerential eﬀects on student achievement in mathematics and on various key aspects of their achievement motivation. Statistical analyses were conducted separately for the highest and intermediate academic track. Correlation analyses showed that measures of teachers’ frame of reference converged only modestly across diﬀerent methods of assessment. Results of hierarchical linear models showed that many motivational-aﬀective student characteristics had only modest variability on the class level. The frame of reference eﬀects were small and most of them were not statistically signiﬁcant. Furthermore, results were inconsistent across frame of reference assessment methods and academic tracks. Future research should address modeling and measurement issues of teachers’ frame of reference, and tackle how to analyze eﬀects of learning environments when the variables of interest show only moderate variability on the class level.",

		"abstract": "This dissertation is focused on the development of the optimal design and analysis for cluster randomized trials. Specifically, we tackle three common questions: whether or not to pair-match clusters, which causal parameter best captures the intervention effect, and how to select the adjustment set for the analysis. We begin by introducing a formal framework for causal inference in Chapter 1. Throughout, the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) trial serves as the motivating example (NCT01864603). SEARCH is an ongoing community randomized trial to evaluate the impact of immediate and streamlined antiretroviral therapy on HIV incidence in rural East Africa.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we consider pair-matching, an intuitive design strategy to protect study validity and to potentially increase power in randomized trials. In a common design, candidate units are identified, and their baseline characteristics are used to create the best n/2 matched pairs. Within the resulting pairs, the intervention is randomized, and the outcomes are measured at the end of follow-up. We consider this design to be adaptive, because the construction of the matched pairs depends on the baseline covariates of all candidate units. As a consequence, the observed data cannot be considered as n/2 independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) pairs of units, as common practice assumes. Instead, the observed data consist of n dependent units. Chapter 2 explores the consequences of adaptive pair-matching in randomized trials for estimation of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE): the intervention effect, given the measured covariates of the n study units. We contrast the unadjusted estimator with TMLE and show substantial efficiency gains from matching and further gains with adjustment.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we compare three causal parameters: the population, conditional and sample average treatment effects. Using a structural causal model, we explicitly define each parameter, discuss interpretation, and formally examine identifiability. To the best of our knowledge, Chapter 3 is the first to propose using TMLE for estimation and inference of the sample effect. In most settings, the sample parameter will be estimated more efficiently than the conditional parameter, which will, in turn, be estimated more efficiently than the population parameter. Finite sample simulations illustrate the potential gains in precision and power from selecting the sample effect as the target of inference.\n\nFinally in Chapter 4, we discuss adjustment for measured covariates during the analysis to reduce variance and increase power in randomized trials. To avoid misleading inference, the analysis plan must be pre-specified. However, it is often unclear a priori which baseline covariates (if any) should be included in the analysis. In the SEARCH trial, for example, there are 16 matched pairs of communities and many potential adjustment variables, including region, HIV prevalence, male circumcision coverage and measures of community-level viral load. In Chapter 4, we propose a rigorous procedure to data-adaptively select the adjustment set, which maximizes the efficiency of the analysis. Specifically, we use cross-validation to select from a pre-specified library the candidate TMLE that minimizes the estimated variance. For further gains in precision, we also propose a collaborative procedure for estimating the known exposure mechanism. Our small sample simulations demonstrate the promise of the methodology to maximize study power, while maintaining nominal confidence interval coverage. Our procedure is tailored to the scientific question (sample vs. population treatment effect) and study design (pair-matched or not) and alleviates many of the common concerns.",

We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine the effect of the number of clusters and the number of subjects per cluster on the statistical power to detect a non-null random effects variance and to compare the empirical type I error rates of the Wald and LR tests. Statistical power increased with increasing number of clusters and number of subjects per cluster. Statistical power was greater for the LR test than for the Wald test. These results applied to both the linear and logistic regressions, but were more pronounced for the latter. The use of the LR test is preferable to the use of the Wald test.",

		"abstract": "Im Zuge der empirischen Wende in der Bildungsforschung und der Formulierung von Bildungsstandards etablierte sich eine kompetenzorientierte Leistungsmessung. Diese setzt ein theoretisches Rahmenmodell für die Testkonstruktion sowie eine empirische Validierung des Rahmenmodells auf der Grundlage der Testergebnisse voraus. Für die Rechtschreibung liegen nur wenige Studien zur kompetenzorientierten Leistungsmessung vor, die diesen Kriterien entsprechen.\n\nIn der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden der Leistungsstand und die Entwicklung der Rechtschreibkompetenz von Fünft-, Sechst- und Siebtklässlerinnen und -klässlern differentiell analysiert. Es wurden dafür Rechtschreibkompetenzdaten aus Entwicklungsstudien und Haupterhebungen der National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) genutzt. Mit Hilfe von getrennten Skalierungen auf Grundlage der Item-Response-Theorie wurden die Daten längsschnittlich modelliert. Als Testinstrument wurde in den NEPS-Rechtschreiberhebungen der Sprachsystematische Rechtschreibtest eingesetzt. Sein theoretisches Rahmenmodell basiert auf den Ergebnissen der graphematischen Forschung und wurde empirisch validiert. Um ein möglichst umfassendes Bild der Rechtschreibkompetenz zu erhalten, wurden quantitative und qualitative Analysen durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse liefern rechtschreibdidaktische Erkenntnisse und wurden zur Hypothesenbildung für weiterführende Forschung herangezogen.",

		"abstract": "\"The routine jobs of yesterday are being replaced by technology and/or shipped off-shore. In their place, job categories that require knowledge management, abstract reasoning, and personal services seem to be growing. The modern workplace requires workers to have broad cognitive and affective skills. Often referred to as \"21st century skills,\" these skills include being able to solve complex problems, to think critically about tasks, to effectively communicate with people from a variety of different cultures and using a variety of different techniques, to work in collaboration with others, to adapt to rapidly changing environments and conditions for performing tasks, to effectively manage one's work, and to acquire new skills and information on one's own. The National Research Council (NRC) has convened two prior workshops on the topic of 21st century skills. The first, held in 2007, was designed to examine research on the skills required for the 21st century workplace and the extent to which they are meaningfully different from earlier eras and require corresponding changes in educational experiences. The second workshop, held in 2009, was designed to explore demand for these types of skills, consider intersections between science education reform goals and 21st century skills, examine models of high-quality science instruction that may develop the skills, and consider science teacher readiness for 21st century skills. The third workshop was intended to delve more deeply into the topic of assessment. The goal for this workshop was to capitalize on the prior efforts and explore strategies for assessing the five skills identified earlier. The Committee on the Assessment of 21st Century Skills was asked to organize a workshop that reviewed the assessments and related research for each of the five skills identified at the previous workshops, with special attention to recent developments in technology-enabled assessment of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In designing the workshop, the committee collapsed the five skills into three broad clusters as shown below: Cognitive skills: nonroutine problem solving, critical thinking, systems thinking Interpersonal skills: complex communication, social skills, team-work, cultural sensitivity, dealing with diversity Intrapersonal skills: self-management, time management, self-development, self-regulation, adaptability, executive functioning. Assessing 21st century skills provides an integrated summary of the presentations and discussions from both parts of the third workshop.\"--Publisher's description",

In nearly every country there was a strong positiverelationship between student enjoyment of mathematics and higherachievement. Home factors were strongly related to mathematicsachievement in every participating country, but relationships betweeninstructional variables and achievement were less clear. In everycountry, the pattern was for the eighth grade student whose parentshad more education to also have higher achievement in mathematics.The amount of television viewing was negatively associated withmathematics achievement. The document's introduction providesinformation on each country's characteristics including demographics,public expenditures on education, organization of educational system.Chapters address:(1) International Student Achievement inMathematics;(2) Average Achievement; (3) Performance on Items withinEach Mathematics Content Area;(4) Students Backgrounds and Attitudestowards Mathematics; and (5) Teachers and Instruction.

The theory is grounded in the causal inference and HLM modeling literature, and the empirical work focuses on commonly-used designs in education research to test intervention effects on student test scores. The main conclusion is that three to four times larger samples are typically required under RD than experimental clustered designs to produce impacts with the same level of statistical precision. Thus, the viability of using RD designs for new impact evaluations of educational interventions may be limited, and will depend on the point of treatment assignment, the availability of pretests, and key research questions.",

		"abstract": "This NCEE Technical Methods report examines how to address the problem of missing data in the analysis of data in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of educational interventions, with a particular focus on the common educational situation in which groups of students such as entire classrooms or schools are randomized. Missing outcome data are a problem for two reasons: (1) the loss of sample members can reduce the power to detect statistically significant differences, and (2) the introduction of non-random differences between the treatment and control groups can lead to bias in the estimate of the intervention's effect. The report reviews a selection of methods available for addressing missing data, and then examines their relative performance using extensive simulations that varied a typical educational RCT on three dimensions: (1) the amount of missing data; (2) the level at which data are missing--at the level of whole schools (the assumed unit of randomization) or for students within schools; and, (3) the underlying missing data mechanism. The performance of the different methods is assessed in terms of bias in both the estimated impact and the associated standard error. Appendices include: (1) Missing Data Bias as a Form of Omitted Variable Bias; (2) Resources for Using Multiple Imputation; (3) Specifications for Missing Data Simulations; (4) Full Set of Simulation Results; and (5) Standards for Judging the Magnitude of the Bias for Different Missing Data Methods.

However, effects that are small by Cohen’s standards are large relative to the impacts of most field-based interventions. These benchmarks also fail to consider important differences in study features, program costs, and scalability. In this paper, I present five broad guidelines for interpreting effect sizes that are applicable across the social sciences. I then propose a more structured schema with new empirical benchmarks for interpreting a specific class of studies: causal research on education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes. Together, these tools provide a practical approach for incorporating study features, cost, and scalability into the process of interpreting the policy importance of effect sizes.",

Two datasets were analyzed, one derived from the High School and Beyond (HS&B) study and the other from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) First Followup. In both cases a two-level model was employed: in the first level we posited a path model for students-within-schools which describes key antecedents to math achievement; at the second level we posited a school-level model to explain effects estimated at the first level. With the HS&B data the first approach we tried  consisted of a centroid factor model estimated separately within each school. This failed to give adequate results due to imprecision of communalities. As a result, a second model was used in which communalities were estimated from all of the data pooled within groups. This gave much more satisfactory results. This latter approach was employed with a somewhat different set of variables on the NELS First Followup data.",

General expressions are obtained for two criteria to evaluate designs for parallel\ngroup studies with two treatments. The  rst is the variance of the estimated treatment e ect and the\nsecond is the extent to which the estimated treatment e ect is changed by adjusting for covariates. It is\nargued that the second of these is more important for cluster randomized trials. Methods of obtaining\nbalanced designs from covariates which are available at the start of a study are proposed. An imbalance\nmeasure is used to compare the extent to which designs balance important covariates between the arms\nof a trial. Several approaches to selecting a well balanced design are possible. A method that randomly\nselects one member from the class of designs with acceptable bias will allow randomization inference\nas well as model-based inference. The methods are illustrated with data from a trial of school-based\nsex education. Copyright ? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

		"abstract": "In randomized clinical trials, adjustments for baseline covariates at both design and analysis stages are highly encouraged by regulatory agencies. A recent trend is to use a model-assisted approach for covariate adjustment to gain credibility and efficiency while producing asymptotically valid inference even when the model is incorrect. In this article we present three considerations for better practice when model-assisted inference is applied to adjust for covariates under simple or covariate-adaptive randomized trials: (1) guaranteed efficiency gain: a model-assisted method should often gain but never hurt efficiency; (2) wide applicability: a valid procedure should be applicable, and preferably universally applicable, to all commonly used randomization schemes; (3) robust standard error: variance estimation should be robust to model misspecification and heteroscedasticity. To achieve these, we recommend a model-assisted estimator under an analysis of heterogeneous covariance working model including all covariates utilized in randomization. Our conclusions are based on an asymptotic theory that provides a clear picture of how covariate-adaptive randomization and regression adjustment alter statistical efficiency. Our theory is more general than the existing ones in terms of studying arbitrary functions of response means (including linear contrasts, ratios, and odds ratios), multiple arms, guaranteed efficiency gain, optimality, and universal applicability.",

Two hundred and two Italian children participated in this study ( M age = 5.6years, SD = 0.3). In kindergarten, a wide range of children’s domain-general and domain-specific skills were assessed through standardized tests. In primary school, children’s reading, spelling, and mathematical competences were assessed through standardized tests. Results showed that domain-specific predictors contribute to the explanation of reading, spelling, and mathematical performances more than domain-general predictors do. Each primary school skill is mainly predicted by their respective domain-specific kindergarten skill, although some cross-domain relations exist, for example, phonological awareness contributing to both reading and mathematical performances.",

Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, this study estimates the degree to which time spent on science and the breadth of science topics/skills covered predict science achievement in the earliest grades of elementary school. Using regression along with school fixed effects and student fixed effects models, we find suggestive evidence in some models (student fixed effects and regression with observable controls) that time on science instruction is related to science achievement but little evidence that the number of science topics/skills covered are related to greater science achievement. These results are generally consistent across student subgroups. We discuss the implications for early science policy and practice.",

		"abstract": "Background:\n              When conducting a randomized controlled trial, it is common to specify in advance the statistical analyses that will be used to analyze the data. Typically, these analyses will involve adjusting for small imbalances in baseline covariates. However, this poses a dilemma, as adjusting for too many covariates can hurt precision more than it helps, and it is often unclear which covariates are predictive of outcome prior to conducting the experiment.\n            \n            \n              Objectives:\n              This article aims to produce a covariate adjustment method that allows for automatic variable selection, so that practitioners need not commit to any specific set of covariates prior to seeing the data.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              In this article, we propose the “leave-one-out potential outcomes” estimator. We leave out each observation and then impute that observation’s treatment and control potential outcomes using a prediction algorithm such as a random forest. In addition to allowing for automatic variable selection, this estimator is unbiased under the Neyman–Rubin model, generally performs at least as well as the unadjusted estimator, and the experimental randomization largely justifies the statistical assumptions made.",

		"abstract": "Chess masters and expert musicians appear to be, on average, more intelligent than the general population. Some researchers have thus claimed that playing chess or learning music enhances children’s cognitive abilities and academic attainment. We here present two meta-analyses assessing the effect of chess and music instruction on children’s cognitive and academic skills. A third meta-analysis evaluated the effects of working memory training—a cognitive skill correlated with music and chess expertise—on the same variables. The results show small to moderate effects. However, the effect sizes are inversely related to the quality of the experimental design (e.g., presence of active control groups). This pattern of results casts serious doubts on the effectiveness of chess, music, and working memory training. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings; extend the debate to other types of training such as spatial training, brain training, and video games; and conclude that far transfer of learning rarely occurs.",

		"abstract": "The relationship between cognitive abilities and academic achievement across schooling from the first to the eleventh grade was analyzed. Information processing speed, visuospatial working memory, number sense, and fluid intelligence were considered predictors of general academic achievement, which was derived from grades in mathematics, language, and biology. This cross-sectional study involved 1560 pupils who were in grades 1–11 at general education schools and were aged from 6.8 to 19.1 years (50.4% were boys). Information processing speed, visuospatial working memory, and number sense were measured using the Choice Reaction Time, Corsi Block-Tapping, and Number Sense computerized tests, respectively. Fluid intelligence was measured using the paper-and-pencil version of the Standard Progressive Matrices test. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were carried out. It was shown that it is possible to describe the structure of the relationship between cognitive abilities and academic achievement for all levels of schooling with a single model. In this model, information processing speed is the key predictor of fluid intelligence, working memory, and number sense, which in turn contribute to individual differences in academic success. Additionally, the specificity of the relationship between individual indicators of cognitive abilities and academic achievement at each level of schooling was revealed.",

		"abstract": "This study examined concurrent and longitudinal relations for the Get Ready to Read! (GRTR) emergent literacy screener. This measure, within a battery of oral language, letter knowledge, decoding, and phonological awareness tests, was administered to 204 preschool children (mean age = 53.6, SD = 5.78; 55% male) from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Subgroups were reassessed at 6 months and 16 and 37 months later. Results indicate strong relations between the GRTR and the literacy and language assessments. Long-term follow-up indicated that the screener was significantly related to some reading-related measures, including decoding skills. These results support the utility of the GRTR as a brief, valid measure of children's emergent literacy skills. The GRTR holds promise as a tool useful for educators, parents, and others in regular contact with preschool children to help determine those who may be at risk for later reading difficulties and could benefit from intervention and focused instruction in emergent literacy.",

To identify these types of knowledge, we examined long-term predictors of high school students’ knowledge of algebra and overall mathematics achievement. Analyses of large, nationally representative, longitudinal data sets from the United States and the United Kingdom revealed that elementary school students’ knowledge of fractions and of division uniquely predicts those students’ knowledge of algebra and overall mathematics achievement in high school, 5 or 6 years later, even after statistically controlling for other types of mathematical knowledge, general intellectual ability, working memory, and family income and education. Implications of these findings for understanding and improving mathematics learning are discussed.",

We address this limitation using nationally representative data following students from Grades 3 to 8. We find that the Black–White science test score gap (–1.07 SD in Grade 3) remains stable over these years, the Hispanic–White gap narrows (–.85 to –.65 SD), and the Asian–White Grade 3 gap (–.31 SD) closes by Grade 8. The female–male Grade 3 gap (–.23 SD) may narrow slightly by eighth grade. Accounting for prior math and reading achievement, socioeconomic status, and classroom fixed effects, Grade 8 racial/ethnic gaps are not statistically significant. The Grade 8 science gender gap disappears after controlling for prior math achievement.",

To do so, we estimated multilevel growth models that included as predictors children’s own general knowledge, reading and mathematics achievement, behavioral self-regulation, sociodemographics, other child- and family-level characteristics (e.g., parenting quality), and school-level characteristics (e.g., racial, ethnic, and economic composition; school academic climate). Analyses of a longitudinal sample of 7,757 children indicated large gaps in general knowledge already evident at kindergarten entry. Kindergarten general knowledge was the strongest predictor of first-grade general knowledge, which in turn was the strongest predictor of children’s science achievement from third to eighth grade. Large science achievement gaps were evident when science achievement measures first became available in third grade. These gaps persisted until at least the end of eighth grade. Most or all of the observed science achievement gaps were explained by the study’s many predictors. Efforts to address science achievement gaps in the United States likely require intensified early intervention efforts, particularly those delivered before the primary grades. If unaddressed, science achievement gaps emerge by kindergarten and continue until at least the end of eighth grade.",

We present findings from the recently released Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–2011 that demonstrate significant gaps in science achievement in kindergarten and first grade by race/ethnicity. We estimate the Black-White science gap in kindergarten at –.82 SD but find only a small gender gap by first grade. Large disparities between Asian student performance in science as compared to mathematics and reading are documented. Student background characteristics and school fixed effects explain nearly 60% of the Black-White and Hispanic-White science achievement gaps in kindergarten.

Students considered to be at highest risk were those who experienced homelessness or high residential mobility (HHM). HHM students were compared with students eligible for free meals, students eligible for reduced price meals, and students who were neither HHM nor low income. Socioeconomic risk and oral reading ability in first grade predicted growth of reading and math achievement in Grades 3 through 8. Risk status predicted achievement beyond the effects of early reading scores and also moderated the prediction of later growth in reading achievement from early oral reading. Results underscore the early emergence and persistence of achievement gaps related to poverty, the high and accumulating risk for HHM students, and the significance of oral reading in first grade as both an early indicator of risk and a potential protective factor.",

		"abstract": "Many interventions targeting cognitive skills or socioemotional skills and behaviors demonstrate initially promising but then quickly disappearing impacts. Our article seeks to identify the key features of interventions, as well as the characteristics and environments of the children and adolescents who participate in them, that can be expected to sustain persistently beneficial program impacts. We describe three such processes: skill-building, foot-in-the-door and sustaining environments. We argue that skill-building interventions should target “trifecta” skills—ones that are malleable, fundamental, and would not have developed eventually in the absence of the intervention. Successful foot-in-the-door interventions equip a child with the right skills or capacities at the right time to avoid imminent risks (e.g., grade failure or teen drinking) or seize emerging opportunities (e.g., entry into honors classes). The sustaining environments perspective views high quality of environments subsequent to the completion of the intervention as crucial for sustaining earlier skill gains. These three perspectives generate both complementary and competing hypotheses regarding the nature, timing, and targeting of interventions that generate enduring impacts.",

This study explored the utility of six analysis metrics in predicting the spelling achievement of school-aged children with literacy learning difficulties via post-hoc analyses of data collected in a clinic. Participants were 48 children aged 7 to 12 years. Spelling accuracy was assessed using the Dalwood Spelling Test (Dalwood Assessment Centre, 2008) at baseline and 37–70 weeks later. Spelling attempts at baseline were analysed using metrics designed to quantify evidence of phonological, orthographic, and/or morphological awareness. Scores from each metric were associated with baseline and later conventional spelling accuracy. A metric which credits evidence of phonological, orthographic and morphological awareness shared a significantly stronger association with baseline conventional spelling accuracy as compared to the remaining metrics. There were no significant differences in the strength of associations among the baseline metrics and later spelling achievement. Supplementary analyses focused exclusively on children’s spelling errors returned a similar pattern of results with a few notable exceptions. The utility of spelling analyses is discussed.",

The current paper relates mathematical skills measured at 54 months to adolescent mathematics achievement using multisite longitudinal data. We find that preschool mathematics ability predicts mathematics achievement through age 15, even after accounting for early reading, cognitive skills, and family and child characteristics. Moreover, we find that growth in mathematical ability between age 54 months and first grade is an even stronger predictor of adolescent mathematics achievement. These results demonstrate the importance of prekindergarten mathematics knowledge and early math learning for later achievement.",

We selected 183 articles, books, papers, and research reports related to prior knowledge. While prior knowledge generally had positive effects on students' performance, the effects varied by assessment method. More specifically, prior knowledge was more likely to have negative or no effects on performance when flawed assessment measures were used. However, in some studies, flawed methods yielded informative results. Thus, in educational research the implications of assessment measures must be considered when examining the effects of prior knowledge.",

		"abstract": "School readiness screenings are prevalent throughout the United States. Although readiness encompasses a multitude of components, readiness assessments generally focus on measuring and predicting children's pre-academic skills and behaviors and are often the basis for placement and programming decisions. However, no quantitative estimates of effect sizes exist for the relations between preschool or kindergarten academic/cognitive and social/behavioral assessments and early school outcomes. This review presents the results of a meta-analysis of cross-time relations of academic/cognitive and social/behavioral assessments from preschool to second grade. Results from 70 longitudinal studies that reported correlations between academic/cognitive and social/behavioral measures administered in preschool or kindergarten and similar measures administered in first and second grade were included in the analysis. Academic/cognitive assessments predicting similar outcomes showed moderate effect sizes across both time spans; effect sizes were small for social/behavioral predictors of early school social outcomes. Effect sizes varied considerably across individual studies and samples. Findings are discussed in terms of assessment and conceptualization of school readiness, the role of school and classroom experiences in contributing to individual differences in school outcomes, and the importance of a quantitative estimate of effect size for early education policy and practice.",

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.",

The general and specific constructs were assumed to vary only in breadth, not order, and two data analytic approaches (i.e., structural equation modeling [SEM] and relative weights analysis) consistent with this theoretical assumption were compared. Conclusions regarding the relative importance of general and specific abilities differed based on data analytic approaches. The SEM approach identified general ability as the strongest and only significant predictor of general academic performance, with neither general nor specific abilities predicting any of the specific subject grade residuals. The relative weights analysis identified verbal reasoning as contributing more than general ability, or other specific abilities, to the explained variance in general academic performance. Verbal reasoning also contributed to most of the explained variance in each of the specific subject grades. These results do not provide support for the utility of predictor-criterion alignment, but they do provide evidence that both general and specific abilities can serve as useful predictors of performance.",

		"abstract": "\"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book\"--",

To be included, a model or theory was required to describe variables important to the performance of individual learners or single instructional tasks. Most models also derived implications for the organization of curriculum and/or group instruction. Following discussions of the eight models, major constructs posited by different theorists are cross-tabulated and related to factors of the model of educational productivity (Walberg, 1980 ).",

Multiple imputation (MI) without considering time trend of a variable may cause it to be unreliable. The article illustrates how to perform MI by using Amelia package in a clinical scenario. Amelia package is powerful in that it allows for MI for time series data. External information on the variable of interest can also be incorporated by using prior or bound argument. Such information may be based on previous published observations, academic consensus, and personal experience. Diagnostics of imputation model can be performed by examining the distributions of imputed and observed values, or by using over-imputation technique.",

		"abstract": "The current paper is a commentary on the Standards of Evidence for Conducting and Reporting Economic Evaluations in Prevention Science (Crowley et al. 2018). Although the standards got a lot right, some important issues were not addressed or could be explored further. Measuring rather than modeling is encouraged whenever possible. That also is in keeping with the approach taken by many prevention researchers. Pre-program planning for collection of data on resources used by individual participants (i.e., costs) is recommended, along with devotion of evaluation resources to cost assessment throughout program implementation. A Bcost study^ should never be an afterthought tacked on as a later aim in a research proposal. Needing inclusion or enhancement in the standards, however, are several key concepts, starting with the often-confused distinction between costs and outcomes. The importance of collecting data on individual-level variability in resource use, i.e., costs, needs to be distinguished from simplistic disaggregation-by-division of program cost totals down to individuals. In some passages of the standards, the uniqueness of individual participants seems dismissed as error variance rather than considered a primary phenomenon for study and understanding. Standards for formatting reports of economic evaluations could themselves be more evidence-based. Missing too is an explicit call for inclusion of the standards’ recommendations in peer review of prevention research proposals, and in funding of prevention research. Finally, we can be confident that the better outcomes the standards promise will come at additional costs to prevention researchers. This commentary concludes by considering whether the standards themselves are cost-beneficial.",

Data on the development of competencies serves as a central point of reference for all other parts of the Panel Study. These competencies have to be relevant not only for a successful and responsible individual life but also for a well-functioning modern democratic society. Hence, the aim is not just to describe the development of such competencies, but also to analyze relevant prerequisites, conditions, and courses of competence acquisition. The lifelong learning perspective will shed light on how different competencies are acquired over the life span, how they interact over time and across educational stages, and in which way they may contribute to individual and group-specific life-course outcomes. This chapter gives an overview on the selection, rational, and conceptualization of competencies within the National Educational Panel Study.",

		"abstract": "Sometimes interventions in randomized\nclinical trials are not allocated to individual patients,\nbut rather to patients in groups. This is called cluster\nallocation, or cluster randomization, and is par-\nticularly common in health services research. Simi-\nlarly, in some types of observational studies, patients\n(or observations) are found in naturally occurring\ngroups, such as neighborhoods. In either situation,\nobservations within a cluster tend to be more alike\nthan observations selected entirely at random. This\nviolates the assumption of independence that is at\nthe heart of common methods of statistical estimation\nand hypothesis testing. Failure to account for the de-\npendence between individual observations and the\ncluster to which they belong can have profound im-\nplications on the design and analysis of such studies.\nTheir p-values will be too small, confidence intervals\ntoo narrow, and sample size estimates too small,\nsometimes to a dramatic degree. This problem is sim-\nilar to that caused by the more familiar ‘‘unit of anal-\nysis error’’ seen when observations are repeated on\nthe same subjects, but are treated as independent.\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an introduc-\ntion to the problem of clustered data in clinical re-\nsearch. It provides guidance and examples of methods\nfor analyzing clustered data and calculating sample\nsizes when planning studies. The article concludes\nwith some general comments on statistical software\nfor cluster data and principles for planning, analyz-\ning, and presenting such studies.

Hedges proposed a correction for such tests by scaling them to control their Type I error rate. This article generalizes the Hedges correction from a posttest-only experimental design to more common designs used in practice. We show that for many experimental designs, the generalized correction controls its Type I error while the Hedges correction does not. The generalized correction, however, necessarily has low power due to its control of the Type I error. Our results imply that using the Hedges correction as prescribed, for example, by the What Works Clearinghouse can lead to incorrect inferences and has important implications for evidence-based education.",

Design: A clustered randomised controlled trial; classes, 1 per school, were assigned to 1 of 3 intervention arms or a control group based on a 2×2 factorial design. The interventions were peer-mentoring and participative learning. Year 7 children (aged 11–12) in the peer-mentoring intervention were paired with year 9 children for 6 weekly mentoring meetings. Year 7 children in the participative learning arm took part in 6 weekly geography lessons using personalised physical activity and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Year 7 children in the combined intervention received both interventions, with the year 9 children only participating in the mentoring sessions. Participants: 1494 year 7 students from 60 schools in the North of England took part in the trial. Of these, 43 students opted out of taking part in the evaluation measurements, 2 moved teaching group and 58 changed school. Valid accelerometry outcome data were collected for 892 students from 53 schools; and well-being outcome data were available for 927 students from 52 schools. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were mean minutes of accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per day, and well-being as evaluated by the KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire. These data were collected 6 weeks after the intervention; a 12-month follow-up is planned.\nResults: No significant effects (main or interaction) were observed for the outcomes. However, small positive differences were found for both outcomes for the participative learning intervention.\nConclusions: These findings suggest that the 2 school-based interventions did not modify levels of physical activity or well-being within the period monitored. Change in physical activity may require more comprehensive individual behavioural intervention, and/or more system-based efforts to address wider environmental influences such as family,",

Study Design and Setting: We reviewed 300 CRTs published between 2000 and 2008. The prevalence of reporting sample size elements from the 2004 CONSORT recommendations was evaluated and a priori estimates compared with those observed in the trial.\nResults: Of the 300 trials, 166 (55%) reported a sample size calculation. Only 36 of 166 (22%) reported all recommended descriptive elements. Elements speciﬁc to CRTs were the worst reported: a measure of within-cluster correlation was speciﬁed in only 58 of 166 (35%). Only 18 of 166 articles (11%) reported both a priori and observed within-cluster correlation values. Except in two cases, observed withincluster correlation values were either close to or less than a priori values.\nConclusion: Even with the CONSORT extension for cluster randomization, the reporting of sample size elements speciﬁc to these trials remains below that necessary for transparent reporting. Journal editors and peer reviewers should implement stricter requirements for authors to follow CONSORT recommendations. Authors should report observed and a priori within-cluster correlation values to enable comparisons between these over a wider range of trials. Ó 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

		"abstract": "Background. Assigning students to different school tracks on the basis of their achievement levels is a widely used strategy that aims at giving students the best possible learning opportunity. There is, however, a growing body of literature that questions such positive effects of tracking. Aims. This study compared the developmental trajectories of reading comprehension and decoding speed between students at academic track schools that typically prepare students for university entrance and students at non-academic track schools that usually prepare students for vocational education. Sample. In a longitudinal design with three occasions of data collection, the authors drew on a sample of N = 1,508 5th graders (age at T1 about 11 years, age at T3 about 14 years) from 60 schools in Germany. The academic track sample comprised n = 568 students; the non-academic track sample comprised n = 940 students.\nMethod. Achievement measures were obtained by standardized tests of reading comprehension and decoding speed. Students at the different tracks were closely matched using propensity scores. To compare students’ growth trajectories between the different school tracks, we applied multi-group latent growth curve models.\nResults. Comparable results were recorded for the complete (unmatched) sample and for the matched pairs. In all cases, students at the different tracks displayed a similar growth in reading comprehension, whereas larger growth rates for students at academic track schools were recorded for decoding speed.\nConclusions. Our ﬁndings contribute to an increasing body of literature suggesting that tracking might have undesired side effects.",

		"abstract": "Education research has experienced a methodological renaissance over the past two decades, with a new focus on large-scale randomized experiments. This wave of experiments has made education research an even more exciting area for statisticians, unearthing many lessons and challenges in experimental design, causal inference, and statistics more broadly. Importantly, educational research and practice almost always occur in a multilevel setting, which makes the statistics relevant to other fields with this structure, including social policy, health services research, and clinical trials in medicine. In this article we first briefly review the history that led to this new era in education research and describe the design features that dominate the modern large-scale educational experiments. We then highlight some of the key statistical challenges in this area, including endogeneity of design, heterogeneity of treatment effects, noncompliance with treatment assignment, mediation, generalizability, and spillover. Though a secondary focus, we also touch on promising trial designs that answer more nuanced questions, such as the SMART design for studying dynamic treatment regimes and factorial designs for optimizing the components of an existing treatment.",

This study addressed whether the size of Head Start’s impacts on children’s access to center-based and high-quality care and their school readiness skills varied by child characteristics, geographic location, and the experiences of children in the control group. Across multiple sets of analyses based on new, innovative statistical methods, findings suggest that the topline Head Start Impact Study results of Head Start’s average impacts mask substantial variation in its effectiveness and that one key source of that variation was in the counterfactual experiences and the context of Head Start sites (as well as the more typically examined child characteristics; e.g., children’s dual language learner status). Implications are discussed for the future of Head Start and further research, as well as the scale-up of other early childhood programs, policies, and practices.",

		"abstract": "Background: The number of clusters in a cluster randomized trial is often low. It is therefore likely random assignment of clusters to treatment conditions results in covariate imbalance. There are no studies that quantify the consequences of covariate imbalance in cluster randomized trials on parameter and standard error bias and on power to detect treatment effects.\nMethods: The consequences of covariance imbalance in unadjusted and adjusted linear mixed models are investigated by means of a simulation study. The factors in this study are the degree of imbalance, the covariate effect size, the cluster size and the intraclass correlation coefficient. The covariate is binary and measured at the cluster level; the outcome is continuous and measured at the individual level.\nResults: The results show covariate imbalance results in negligible parameter bias and small standard error bias in adjusted linear mixed models. Ignoring the possibility of covariate imbalance while calculating the sample size at the cluster level may result in a loss in power of at most 25 % in the adjusted linear mixed model. The results are more severe for the unadjusted linear mixed model: parameter biases up to 100 % and standard error biases up to 200 % may be observed. Power levels based on the unadjusted linear mixed model are often too low. The consequences are most severe for large clusters and/or small intraclass correlation coefficients since then the required number of clusters to achieve a desired power level is smallest.\nConclusions: The possibility of covariate imbalance should be taken into account while calculating the sample size of a cluster randomized trial. Otherwise more sophisticated methods to randomize clusters to treatments should be used, such as stratification or balance algorithms. All relevant covariates should be carefully identified, be actually measured and included in the statistical model to avoid severe levels of parameter and standard error bias and insufficient power levels.",

		"abstract": "The popularity of online surveys has increased the prominence of using sampling weights to enhance claims of representativeness. Yet, much uncertainty remains regarding how these weights should be employed in survey experiment analysis: should they be used? If so, which estimators are preferred? We offer practical advice, rooted in the Neyman–Rubin model, for researchers working with survey experimental data. We examine simple, efficient estimators, and give formulas for their biases and variances. We provide simulations that examine these estimators as well as real examples from experiments administered online through YouGov. We find that for examining the existence of population treatment effects using high-quality, broadly representative samples recruited by top online survey firms, sample quantities, which do not rely on weights, are often sufficient. We found that sample average treatment effect (SATE) estimates did not appear to differ substantially from their weighted counterparts, and they avoided the substantial loss of statistical power that accompanies weighting. When precise estimates of population average treatment effects (PATE) are essential, we analytically show poststratifying on survey weights and/or covariates highly correlated with outcomes to be a conservative choice. While we show substantial gains in simulations, we find limited evidence of them in practice.",

		"abstract": "Objective To assess the impact of the 2004 extension of the CONSORT guidelines on the reporting and methodological quality of cluster randomised trials.\nDesign Methodological review of 300 randomly sampled cluster randomised trials. Two reviewers independently abstracted 14 criteria related to quality of reporting and four methodological criteria specific to cluster randomised trials. We compared manuscripts published before CONSORT (2000-4) with those published after CONSORT (2005-8). We also investigated differences by journal impact factor, type of journal, and trial setting.\nData sources A validated Medline search strategy.\nEligibility criteria for selecting studies Cluster randomised trials published in English language journals, 2000-8.\nResults There were significant improvements in five of 14 reporting criteria: identification as cluster randomised; justification for cluster randomisation; reporting whether outcome assessments were blind; reporting the number of clusters randomised; and reporting the number of clusters lost to follow-up. No significant improvements were found in adherence to methodological criteria. Trials conducted in clinical rather than non-clinical settings and studies published in medical journals with higher impact factor or general medical journals were more likely to adhere to recommended reporting and methodological criteria overall, but there was no evidence that improvements after publication of the CONSORT extension for cluster trials were more likely in trials conducted in clinical settings nor in trials published in either general medical journals or in higher impact factor journals.\nConclusion The quality of reporting of cluster randomised trials improved in only a few aspects since the publication of the extension of CONSORT for cluster randomised trials, and no improvements at all were observed in essential methodological features. Overall, the adherence to reporting and methodological guidelines for cluster randomised trials remains suboptimal, and further efforts are needed to improve both reporting and methodology.",

We review the concept and demonstrate how it can be used to assess the sensitivity of design decisions and balance competing needs. For observational studies, this methodology enables selection of the most informative study units. For experimental studies, it entails selecting and assigning study units to intervention conditions in the most informative manner. We blend optimal design methods with purposeful sampling to show how these two concepts balance competing needs when there are multiple study aims, a common situation in implementation research.",

		"abstract": "An increasing number of studies are being performed in educational research to evaluate new teaching methods and approaches. These studies could be performed more efficiently and deliver more convincing results if they more strictly applied and complied with recognized standards of scientific studies. Such an approach could substantially increase the quality in particular of prospective, two-arm (intervention) studies that aim to compare two different teaching methods. A key standard in such studies is randomization, which can minimize systematic bias in study findings; such bias may result if the two study arms are not structurally equivalent. If possible, educational research studies should also achieve this standard, although this is not yet generally the case. Some difficulties and concerns exist, particularly regarding organizational and methodological aspects. An important point to consider in educational research studies is that usually individuals cannot be randomized, because of the teaching situation, and instead whole groups have to be randomized (so-called “cluster randomization”). Compared with studies with individual randomization, studies with cluster randomization normally require (significantly) larger sample sizes and more complex methods for calculating sample size. Furthermore, cluster-randomized studies require more complex methods for statistical analysis. The consequence of the above is that a competent expert with respective special knowledge needs to be involved in all phases of cluster-randomized studies.\n  \n  Studies to evaluate new teaching methods need to make greater use of randomization in order to achieve scientifically convincing results. Therefore, in this article we describe the general principles of cluster randomization and how to implement these principles, and we also outline practical aspects of using cluster randomization in prospective, two-arm comparative educational research studies.",

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between neurocognition, theory of mind, and community functioning in a sample of 43 outpatients with serious mental illness (SMI). Relationships between baseline values and changes over time were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Results showed that: 1. Neurocognition and theory of mind were each associated with community functioning at baseline. 2. Community functioning improved over approximately 12 months of treatment. 3. Greater improvement in neurocognition over time predicted higher rates of improvement in community functioning. 4. Theory of mind did not predict change in community functioning after controlling for neurocognition. 5. The effect of change in neurocognition on community functioning did not depend on the effect of baseline neurocognition. This study provides empirical support that individuals with SMI may experience improvement in community functioning, especially when they also experience improvement in neurocognition. Limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed.",

		"abstract": "Background: The use of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in education has increased signiﬁcantly over the last 15 years. However, their use has also been subject to sustained and rather trenchant criticism from signiﬁcant sections of the education research community. Key criticisms have included the claims that: it is not possible to undertake RCTs in education; RCTs are blunt research designs that ignore context and experience; RCTs tend to generate simplistic universal laws of ‘cause and eﬀect’; and that they are inherently descriptive and contribute little to theory.\nPurpose: This article seeks to assess the above four criticisms of RCTs by considering the actual evidence in relation to the use of RCTs in education in practice. Design and methods: The article is based upon a systematic review that has sought to identify and describe all RCTs conducted in educational settings and including a focus on educational outcomes between 1980 and 2016. The search is limited to articles and reports published in English.\nResults: The systematic review found a total of 1017 unique RCTs that have been completed and reported between 1980 and 2016. Just over three quarters of these have been produced over the last 10 years, reﬂecting the signiﬁcant increase in the use of RCTs in recent years. Overall, just over half of all RCTs identiﬁed were conducted in North America and a little under a third in Europe. The RCTs cover a wide range of educational settings and focus on an equally wide range of educational interventions and outcomes. The ﬁndings not only disprove the claim that it is not possible to do RCTs in education but also provide some supporting evidence to challenge the other three key criticisms outlined earlier.\nConclusions: While providing evidence to counter the four criticisms outlined earlier, the article suggests that there remains signiﬁcant progress to be made. The article concludes by outlining some key challenges for researchers undertaking RCTs in education.",

In celebration of 25 years of Statistics in Medicine, this paper reviews recent developments, particularly those that featured in the journal. Issues in design such as sample size calculations, matched paired designs, cohort versus cross-sectional designs, and practical design problems are covered. Developments in analysis include modiﬁcation of robust methods to cope with small numbers of clusters, generalized estimation equations, population averaged and cluster speciﬁc models. Finally, issues on presenting data, some other clustering issues and the general problem of evaluating complex interventions are brieﬂy mentioned. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

		"abstract": "Linear mixed-effects models are commonly used to analyze clustered data structures. There are numerous packages to fit these models in R and conduct likelihood-based inference. The implementation of resampling-based procedures for inference are more limited. In this paper, we introduce the lmeresampler package for bootstrapping nested linear mixed-effects models fit via lme4 or nlme. Bootstrap estimation allows for bias correction, adjusted standard errors and confidence intervals for small samples sizes and when distributional assumptions break down. We will also illustrate how bootstrap resampling can be used to diagnose this model class. In addition, lmeresampler makes it easy to construct interval estimates of functions of model parameters.",

		"abstract": "Cluster randomized trials involving participants nested within intact treatment and control groups are commonly performed in various educational, psychological, and biomedical studies. However, recruiting and retaining intact groups present various practical, financial, and logistical challenges to evaluators and often, cluster randomized trials are performed with a low number of clusters (~20 groups). Although multilevel models are often used to analyze nested data, researchers may be concerned of potentially biased results due to having only a few groups under study. Cluster bootstrapping has been suggested as an alternative procedure when analyzing clustered data though it has seen very little use in educational and psychological studies. Using a Monte Carlo simulation that varied the number of clusters, average cluster size, and intraclass correlations, we compared standard errors using cluster bootstrapping with those derived using ordinary least squares regression and multilevel models. Results indicate that cluster bootstrapping, though more computationally demanding, can be used as an alternative procedure for the analysis of clustered data when treatment effects at the group level are of primary interest. Supplementary material showing how to perform cluster bootstrapped regressions using R is also provided.",

		"abstract": "Researchers commonly interpret effect sizes by applying benchmarks proposed by Jacob Cohen over a half century ago. However, effects that are small by Cohen’s standards are large relative to the impacts of most field-based interventions. These benchmarks also fail to consider important differences in study features, program costs, and scalability. In this article, I present five broad guidelines for interpreting effect sizes that are applicable across the social sciences. I then propose a more structured schema with new empirical benchmarks for interpreting a specific class of studies: causal research on education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes. Together, these tools provide a practical approach for incorporating study features, costs, and scalability into the process of interpreting the policy importance of effect sizes.",
